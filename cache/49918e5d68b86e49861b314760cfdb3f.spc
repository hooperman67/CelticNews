<p>There have been a couple of articles lately, where the SMSM has been discussing the idea of Kyogo Furuhashi returning to Celtic.</p>
<p>Now, granted, this wouldn&#8217;t be the first time something like this could happen.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen two examples of it already this season.</p>
<p>With Jota returning and the return of Kieran Tierney imminent at the end of the current season.</p>
<p>But a return for Kyogo?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely for a few reasons, but the main one would be his shoulder injury.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubting Celtic got away with one on that front.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised it was picked up on during his medical for Rennes, but it was discussed in the media recently, and it would appear at the time, Rennes wanted him despite the threat of the injury hanging over the Japanese international.</p>
<p>Michael Nicholson is probably sitting in the Celtic boardroom, grinning to himself contentedly about that.</p>
<p>£10 million secured for a player who had an historic injury, and he is 30 years old.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-celtic-definitely-came-out-of-that-deal-better-off-than-rennes-did" style="position: relative">Celtic definitely came out of that deal better off than Rennes did.</h3>

<p style="position: relative">Spare a thought for the Rennes board, though, when you consider they forked out £10 million for Kyogo, and now they have a manager who isn&#8217;t even interested in using him.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Obviously, they weren&#8217;t to know that at the time, as Kyogo was specifically chosen by the now sacked Jorge Sampaoli.</p>
<p style="position: relative">In the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/kyogo-celtic-rennes-transfer-return-34866621">Record</a> this morning, they&#8217;ve once again gone all Football Insider, referencing the opinion of Marvin Bartley when it comes to the idea of a return to Celtic for Kyogo.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Before that, they detail how Habib Beye, the current Rennes manager, states that Kyogo is out of the picture due to his style of play.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Here, the Record picks up on the views of Beye on Kyogo:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote" style="position: relative">
<p>But speaking to the French outlet, Beye insisted that the fitness had not factored into his thinking about playing the frontman &#8211; who has made just four appearances since his Parkhead exit without scoring.</p>
<p>He insisted that the decision comes down to the way he wants his frontmen to play: Kyogo has different abilities from other strikers, he needs to have a focal point, because he&#8217;s very mobile.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a combination player, and we&#8217;re working a lot at the moment on these notions of complementarity attack, so that he feels confident and fully involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reading-that-it-highlights-another-reason-why-it-s-unlikely-a-return-to-celtic-would-be-on-the-cards-for-kyogo" style="position: relative">Reading that, it highlights another reason why it&#8217;s unlikely a return to Celtic would be on the cards for Kyogo.</h3>

<p style="position: relative">I think it&#8217;s fair to say that his style of play didn&#8217;t fit into Brendan Rodgers&#8217; way of doing things either.</p>
<p style="position: relative">This was clearly evidenced by the sharp decline in the amount of goals he contributed after the departure of Ange Postecoglou.</p>
<p style="position: relative">In reality, Kyogo&#8217;s situation really is a hard luck story.</p>
<p style="position: relative">But ultimately, the striker stated he wanted to go to a club that would enhance his chances of playing in the next World Cup for Japan.</p>
<p style="position: relative">That&#8217;s understandable, but the move to Rennes has turned out to be a nightmare.</p>
<p style="position: relative">If anything, it has set back any chance he has of going to the World Cup with Japan.</p>
<p style="position: relative">While I feel sorry for Kyogo, he made his choice.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I wrote an <a href="https://readceltic.com/2025/03/08/matt-oriley-and-kyogo-are-proof-positive-that-the-urge-to-leave-celtic-for-for-bigger-and-better-things-doesnt-always-end-in-superstardom/">article</a> recently, where I stated the grass wasn&#8217;t always greener when you move away from Celtic.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I think Kyogo is the perfect example of that.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Despite what&#8217;s happened to him, it&#8217;s highly unlikely we&#8217;ll see him back at Celtic in the future.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Would I want him back?</p>
<p style="position: relative">He&#8217;s a player I always admired, but we need to be looking forward.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I think now, bringing him back would be backward step.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I wish him well for the future.</p>
<p style="position: relative">He had his time at Celtic.</p>
<p style="position: relative">But I don&#8217;t think a return would benefit either party now.</p>

<p>During Brendan Rodgers&#8217; first stint at the club, we had Moussa Dembele, Olivier Ntcham, and Odsonne Edouard.</p>
<p>Not long after that, we had Christopher Jullien join the club. He will always be remembered for his strike against Lazio in the Europa League in October of 2019.</p>
<p>Sadly, since Ange Postecoglou&#8217;s time at Celtic, followed by Brendan Rodgers&#8217; second stint, we have had no French players of note join the club since Chris Jullien left.</p>
<p>One thing we can say for sure is that all of the French contingent that played at Celtic during Brendan Rodgers&#8217; time achieved great things.</p>
<p>Who can forget Moussa Dembele&#8217;s goal at Ibrox, followed by Odsonne Edouard&#8217;s sublime finish to win at Ibrox with ten men this time seven years ago?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it ironic that Sunday&#8217;s game at Celtic Park is the first game where more than 800 fans have been allowed to attend after the Ibrox side threw their toys out of the pram after that famous win?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope we give the 2,600 Ibrox fans at Celtic Park on Sunday a game to remember.</p>
<p>For all the wrong reasons.</p>

<p style="position: relative"><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/green-brigade-blast-celtic-board-34861402">News</a> has emerged early this afternoon that the Celtic board have blocked the Ultras group from using the Tifo they had planned for Sunday.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Since no explanation has been given as to why by our uber communicative board, we can only assume it was blocked because it might offend the delicate sensitivities of the Ibrox support?</p>
<p style="position: relative">Well, it&#8217;s either that or the board is grandstanding after their recent statement regarding the &#8220;Show Israel the Red Card&#8221; and Brendan &#8220;Bik&#8221; McFarlane banners.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Since they do not deign to give any explanations for their actions, we are left to speculate as to the reasons behind their decision making.</p>
<h3 id="h-we-discussed-in-depth-the-recent-statement-by-the-celtic-board-regarding-banners-on-the-latest-trinity-tims-podcast" class="wp-block-heading" style="position: relative">We discussed in depth the recent statement by the Celtic board regarding banners on the latest Trinity Tims podcast.</h3>
<blockquote class="youtube" style="position: relative" data-id="A6Ci3m_rbqw"><p>YouTube: Hampden Here We Come</p></blockquote>
<p style="position: relative">Rest assured we&#8217;ll be discussing this subject again on our next show.</p>
<p style="position: relative">The Green Brigade has released a statement slamming the decision to block the Tifo.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Celtic FC v FC Bayern München - UEFA Champions League 2024/25 League Knockout Play-off First Leg" src="https://cdn.readeverything.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2025/03/2199184919.jpg" alt="Ian MacNicol/Getty Images Sport" data-portal-copyright="Ian MacNicol/Getty Images Sport" data-image="i9jt8v98qy1x" /></p>
<p style="position: relative">It doesn&#8217;t say what the Tifo was about, as I&#8217;m sure they wanted to reveal it on Sunday, but it&#8217;s pretty damning in terms of the way it calls out the board.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Here it is in it&#8217;s entirety:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote" style="position: relative"><p>Unfortunately, there will be no traditional tifo in the north curve for Sunday&#8217;s derby following a refusal by the Celtic board.</p>
<p>Tifos are now customary for major fixtures and widely accepted to add to the occasion and atmosphere. It is therefore particularly disappointing to lose this when opposition fans will return to the derby in reasonable number for the first time in almost seven years, eager to make their mark.</p>
<p>Two recent fixtures are cited as justification for refusing the derby tifo, with appeasing loyalists and Zionists shamefully being put ahead of the interests of Celtic fans.</p>
<p>Last month, thousands of Celtic fans willingly participated in a tifo to &#8220;Show Israel the red card.&#8221; This launched a global campaign of almost 150 similar actions across 126 sports clubs from 31 countries and six continents.</p>
<p>All followed the example of Celtic: a football club held in the highest esteem for reasons beyond sport. Despite demonstrable proof of widescale support for Palestine across the fanbase, the Celtic board continues to sanction our group, and individuals, for this sentiment.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, we paid tribute to a friend and lifelong Celtic supporter in Bik McFarlane. Bik was a hero to many and is widely recognised as a pivotal part in bringing Ireland beyond armed struggle.</p>
<p>While the Celtic board shamelessly commodifies aspects of Irishness, including an earlier era of armed struggle, it sanctions our group for expressions which, again, carry broad demonstrable support.</p>
<p>Despite approaching our 20th season inside Celtic Park, we continue to face the same intransigence from a Celtic board unwilling to engage with fans and evolve alongside fan culture.</p>
<p>The manager recently correctly pointed to how clubs engage with supporters in other countries; until this happens, the same tedious cycles, distractions and disruptions will inevitably continue.</p>
<p>We urge Michael Nicholson and Chris McKay to revise the club&#8217;s entire fan strategy and to do so in consultation with fans.</p></blockquote>
<p style="position: relative">One of the key take outs for me in that statement is relating to the way the &#8220;Show Israel the Red Card&#8221; campaign resulted in 126 other football clubs worldwide engaging with this.</p>
<h3 id="h-the-celtic-board-are-but-a-few-men-if-they-were-offended-by-this-action-then-maybe-they-shouldn-t-be-involved-in-a-club-like-ours-then" class="wp-block-heading" style="position: relative">The Celtic board are but a few men, if they were offended by this action, then maybe they shouldn&#8217;t be involved in a club like ours then?</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Celtic v Bayern Munich - UEFA Champions League Playoff" src="https://cdn.readeverything.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2025/03/2198551381.jpg" alt="Paul Devlin - SNS Group/SNS Group/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Paul Devlin - SNS Group/SNS Group/Getty Images" data-image="oqtm5k6cafk4" /></p>
<p style="position: relative">As the GB quite rightly points out, they are quite happy to &#8220;shamelessly commodify&#8221; aspects of the club&#8217;s Irishness when it comes to making money out of it, but then they pick and choose what elements of the club&#8217;s Irishness the fans are allowed engage with, or what banners they&#8217;re allowed to create relating to it.</p>
<p style="position: relative">However, the below line from the statement is what stands out most to me:</p>
<p style="position: relative"><em>Despite approaching our 20th season inside Celtic Park, we continue to face the same intransigence from a Celtic board unwilling to engage with fans and evolve alongside fan culture.</em></p>
<p style="position: relative">The board&#8217;s refusal to <a href="https://readceltic.com/2025/03/11/since-celtic-choose-to-say-nothing-when-it-comes-to-referees-then-they-get-nothing-mclean-is-referee-with-beaton-as-var/">engage </a>with fans, and the vague language in their recent statement, shows almost an element of cowardice on their behalf.</p>
<p style="position: relative">As we said on our recent podcast, if they had something to say about the banners, why didn&#8217;t they actually say it?</p>
<p style="position: relative">And by that, I mean why didn&#8217;t they say which banners offended them, why they offended them, and what their response to these banners might be?</p>
<h3 id="h-in-other-words-tackle-the-issue-head-on-instead-of-skirting-it" class="wp-block-heading" style="position: relative">In other words, tackle the issue head on, instead of skirting it.</h3>
<p style="position: relative">Which is exactly what they&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p style="position: relative">They couldn&#8217;t namecheck the banners and say that they offended them because that would mean they were distancing themselves from our Irishness firstly, and secondly, that they found that &#8220;Showing Israel the Red Card&#8221; was unpalatable or offensive to them.</p>
<p style="position: relative">They are blocking the planned Tifo for Sunday for one of two reasons.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Either they do not want to offend the Ibrox side, or they are following through on their recent statement relating to the banners.</p>
<p style="position: relative">If it&#8217;s the former point, I can only assume it&#8217;s a celebration of our Irishness that the Ibrox side and their ilk will find offensive.</p>
<p style="position: relative">And if that&#8217;s the case, they are total hypocrites, and gutless to boot.</p>
<p style="position: relative">If it&#8217;s the latter, then put simply, they need to explain themselves.</p>
<p style="position: relative">But, as we&#8217;re all aware, they won&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="position: relative">They never do.</p>
<p style="position: relative">If what I&#8217;m saying is offensive to them, then if they actually explained their motives, I wouldn&#8217;t be forced to speculate.</p>
<p style="position: relative">You know they won&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="position: relative">But I&#8217;ll say one thing, the Green Brigade are spot on when they say they need to revise their entire fan strategy.</p>
<p style="position: relative">If they even have one, that is.</p>
<p style="position: relative">As far as I can see, there isn&#8217;t one.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Simply because they never engage with us.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Will that happen any time soon?</p>
<p style="position: relative">I won&#8217;t hold my breath.</p>

<p>Now, I think it&#8217;s safe to say Igamane may have been in the shop window about 6 weeks ago, but he has been experiencing a pretty barren spell since his prolific scoring spree around Christmas time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that hasn&#8217;t deterred Sevilla from declaring interest in the Moroccan hit man.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/hamza-igamane-set-84m-sevilla-34852054">Record</a> this morning, Sevilla are &#8220;preparing&#8221; a bid of £8.4 million for the Moroccan superstar.</p>
<p>The source of this amazing story?</p>
<h3 id="h-well-it-appears-to-be-from-a-blogger-who-just-as-i-blog-about-celtic-blogs-about-sevilla" class="wp-block-heading">Well, it appears to be from a blogger who, just as I blog about Celtic, blogs about Sevilla.</h3>

<p>The site is called <a href="https://www.vamosmisevillafc.com/el-futurible-delantero-del-sevilla-eleva-su-cache/">SAMOSSEVILLA</a>, and as I do here at Read Celtic, it discusses all things Sevilla related.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Transfer rumours, club news, etc. etc.</p>
<p>I would never claim to be a credible source for the Scottish Mainstream Sports Media, nor would I ever expect the SMSM to use my work as a source for theirs.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I would be offended if they did, considering they often use Football Insider as a source.</p>
<p>For me to be as much as associated with a site like that, well, I would find that highly offensive!</p>
<p>You can rest assured the SMSM would never use my site as a source.</p>

<p>Which is ironically what I&#8217;m doing right now.</p>
<p>Robbie Copeland has gone looking for a story and found one in the Spanish blogosphere.</p>
<p>He has used a site that doesn&#8217;t even have an author&#8217;s name on it with the titled credited to &#8220;vmscom&#8221;.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s nobody who can actually be contacted to verify this story.</p>
<p>Below is the literal translation of the story:</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sevilla&#8217;s potential striker is increasing his cachet</h3>
<p>March 12, 2025 by <a href="https://www.vamosmisevillafc.com/author/vmscom/">vmscom</a></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Víctor Orta&#8217;s biggest pending issue at Sevilla FC, since his arrival two summers ago, is acquiring a striker who at least scores goals.</em></p>
<p><em>As we&#8217;ve already mentioned, while waiting for the possible signing of Akor Adams, who is in his final phase of recovery, he has another potential striker in mind for next year.</em></p>
<p><em>This is Hamza Igamane, a 21-year-old Moroccan striker for Glasgow Rangers, who is breaking out this season with 13 goals and 3 assists in 35 matches, drawing comparisons from many to former Atletico player and compatriot Youseff En-Nesyri.</em></p>
<p><em>He will be playing alongside the former Sevilla player in two very upcoming matches: the second leg of the Europa League round of 16, with the Scots leading 3-1, and the call-up to Morocco for this international break.</em></p>
<p><em>This is the Scottish team&#8217;s first call-up for the striker, which will further boost his stature ahead of the upcoming summer transfer window.</em></p>
<p><em>Valued at 2.5 million by Transfermarkt, we already reported this week that Sevilla were preparing an initial offer of 10 million, which could fall short if the young striker continues to reach levels like those with his national team.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ve read that, can you honestly tell me that this piece is written by a creditable source who has inside knowledge of transfers at Sevilla?</p>
<p>It is a blog.</p>
<p>And it is pure speculation.</p>
<p>No more, no less.</p>
<p>The SMSM are attempting to put Igamane in the shop window.</p>
<h3 id="h-the-same-way-they-attempted-to-put-alfredo-morelos-in-the-shop-window-back-in-2017-with-the-mystery-7-5-million-bid-from-china" class="wp-block-heading">The same way they attempted to put Alfredo Morelos in the shop window back in 2017, with the mystery £7.5 million bid from China.</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Rangers v Heart of Midlothian - Cinch Premiership" src="https://cdn.readeverything.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2025/03/1258323498.jpg" alt="Rob Casey - SNS Group/SNS Group/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Rob Casey - SNS Group/SNS Group/Getty Images" data-image="v789kwjhbzk9" /></p>
<p>This smacks of the exact same thing.</p>
<p>The exact same kind of desperation.</p>
<p>On a week where the continued financial difficulties of the Ibrox club have once again been laid bare, isn&#8217;t it a coincidence that a story such as this then appears?</p>
<p>Well, Igamane would want to be rediscovering his scoring touch in order for anyone to be showing interest in him.</p>
<p>I guess he&#8217;ll have the perfect opportunity on Sunday to do that.</p>
<p>And if he does, his value will increase from £8.4 million to £14 million.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>A Sevilla blogger&#8230;</p>
<p>You couldn&#8217;t make it up.</p>
<p>These people really do steal a wage at times.</p>

<p>The former Celtic player&#8217;s stock has soared during his time at Bayer Leverkusen, culminating in winning a Bundesliga title. along with the DFB Pokal in the 2023/24 season.</p>
<p>Frimpong has been ever-present at right back for the Bundesliga Champions, but it&#8217;s looking likely he&#8217;ll move on to bigger things once the season concludes.</p>
<p>Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona are all reported to be interested in the Dutch international.</p>
<p>Which is great news for Celtic.</p>
<p>If a bidding war starts between these clubs for Frimpong, who knows what the final transfer fee will be for him?</p>
<p>Leverkusen currently value him at about £34 million, meaning that due to Celtic&#8217;s 30% sell on clause, the club could make as much as £10.2 million from his sale.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s if he goes for transfer the fee he&#8217;s valued at.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anything-more-and-celtic-stand-to-make-more">Anything more, and Celtic stand to make more.</h3>
<p>Whatever way you look at it, it will be an excellent piece of business by Celtic, despite the fact a lot of people were scratching their heads when he left the club suddenly back in 2021.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s estimated Celtic made £10 million for Frimpong back then.</p>
<p>The fact that they could make more out of the sell on clause they negotiated for him is smart business from any perspective.</p>
<p>I know I give the board a hard time more often than not, but credit where it&#8217;s due on this piece of business.</p>
<p>It once again shows the sharpness of our transfer dealings, especially when it comes to selling our top assets.</p>
<p>We know that the board are excellent at this aspect of transfer dealings, it&#8217;s how they deal with player purchases, or lack thereof, that gets us wound up most of the time.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-contrast-that-to-the-story-coming-out-of-ibrox-earlier-today-and-it-really-shows-the-level-that-celtic-operate-at-in-comparison-to-them">Contrast that to the story coming out of Ibrox earlier today, and it really shows the level that Celtic operate at in comparison to them.</h3>

<p>In fact there really is no comparison at all.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the story in the Record this morning, I&#8217;ll let the headlines do the talking:</p>
<p><strong>Rangers loan against future transfer fees sees 2 clubs namechecked in documents over outstanding payments</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ibrox side have taken out an unspecified amount with industry leaders MacQuarie Bank </strong></p>
<p>Where to start with that?</p>
<p>Things are so bad over there, all while the yanks are doing their <a href="https://readceltic.com/2025/03/10/what-does-the-ibrox-takeover-mean-for-celtic-in-reality-it-should-mean-nothing-at-all/">due diligence</a> of course, that they had to take a loan out against transfer fees owed to them by FC Twente and Parma for the transfers of Sam Lammers and Antonio Colak.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.readeverything.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2025/03/1258213229.jpg" alt="Rob Casey - SNS Group/SNS Group/Getty Images" title="St Mirren v Rangers - Cinch Premiership" data-portal-copyright="Rob Casey - SNS Group/SNS Group/Getty Images" data-image="kdkxx34sk7f1"></p>
<p>Of course, Graeme Young, the writer of this piece, made out like it was a thing of nothing.</p>
<p>Stating that MacQuarie Bank are &#8220;Industry leaders&#8221; when it comes to things like this.</p>
<p>And because Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Southampton have done it in the past, it&#8217;s all tickedy boo.</p>
<p>Nothing to fret about here.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-s-all-fine-and-dandy-but-epl-clubs-like-that-have-huge-revenue-streams-and-they-aren-t-hemorrhaging-on-an-annual-basis-to-the-extent-the-ibrox-club-are">That&#8217;s all fine and dandy, but EPL clubs like that have huge revenue streams and they aren&#8217;t hemorrhaging on an annual basis to the extent the Ibrox club are.</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s extremely telling how bad the cash flow issues are over at Ibrox when in the same week they had another share issue, and then applied for a loan for an &#8220;unspecified amount&#8221; relating to these two transfers .</p>
<p>Below is the reasoning for the loan:</p>

<p>And now – in a report lodged to Companies House – it appears FC Twente and Parma are the clubs who R*****s are awaiting payments from and sparked the decision to seek the cash now. The clubs, named as &#8216;FCT&#8217; and &#8216;PC&#8217; in the paperwork, have both been involved in deals in recent years. The Eredivisie side struck an agreement to sign&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sam-lammers">Sam Lammers</a>&nbsp;in the summer of 2024, while Antonio Colak headed to Italy in the summer of 2023.</p>

<p>They obviously cannot wait for these payments.</p>

<p>When you consider that previous chairman John Bennett refused point blank to take out &#8220;high interest&#8221; loans like this with banks like MacQuarie Bank, this seems like a forced shift in attitude from current hierarchy at the Ibrox club.</p>
<p>I leave you with what Bennett had to say about taking loans out with institutes like MacQuarie:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have had numerous approaches, including in November. It is so interesting, they come to you and it could be equity, it could be family offices, it could be banks such as MacQuarie Bank and they are active in the football space. They can&#8217;t touch our terms, What I have been saying and a number of us have been saying is &#8216;Ok, those are interesting approaches&#8217;. I can tell you that one of them was at 13 per cent per annum.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not paying that. We are no longer paying nine, we are no longer paying eight, six is the new benchmark. If those providers can come in and beat that at two levels &#8211; a lower coupon, because six is the new benchmark, and we have driven the cost of funding down to six.</p>
<p>I think that is one of the lowest numbers in the whole of football in Britain for loans. But also on security. I can assure you they want a whole lot more security and a higher coupon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That speaks for itself.</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t be taking a loan like that out unless you were really badly stuck.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Paddy Stewart wishes he operated a trading model like Celtic.</p>
<p>Where we can make huge money from a player we sold 4 years ago.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the difference between us and them.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s why I think the Yanks will run a mile! </p>

<p>Apparently, a guy who played only 5 times back in 2006 for the deid club while on loan from Manchester United, is in a position to tell us that Bazza is going to own Brendan Rodgers in next Sunday&#8217;s Glasgow Derby.</p>
<p>In fact, Bardsley believes the Ibrox side are 10 times, YES, 10 times more likely to do the business against Celtic than they were under Philippe Clement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure you can put a number on something like that, but Bardsley has given it a shot.</p>
<p>In true Football Insider style reportage, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/former-rangers-star-bullish-celtic-34840066">Record</a> has decided to pluck the opinion of a &#8220;former R*****s star&#8221; out of thin air.</p>
<p>I guess if you played just 5 times for them, that must make you a &#8220;former star&#8221; then?</p>
<p>According to the headline in Record, it does anyway:</p>
<p><strong><em>Former Rangers star in bullish Celtic clash prediction as Barry Ferguson told where he&#8217;s TEN times better than Clement</em></strong></p>
<p>You read a headline like that, and you just shake your head.</p>
<p>What next?</p>
<p>Former Celtic Superstar Rafael Scheidt predicts Brendan Rodgers will lord over &#8220;rookie&#8221; Barry Ferguson in O** F*** Derby?</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-even-more-true-football-insider-style-expert-bardsley-is-predicting-that-frank-lampard-will-get-the-ibrox-job">In even more true Football Insider style, &#8220;expert&#8221; Bardsley is predicting that Frank Lampard will get the Ibrox job.</h3>

<p>Here are the opening paragraphs to this masterpiece:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Rangers are TEN times more likely to do the business against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>&nbsp;than they were under Philippe Clement, now Barry Ferguson has the reins.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the view of ex-Gers defender Phil Bardsley, who also doesn&#8217;t think the door is fully closed on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a>&nbsp;getting the permanent job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I guess Bardsley wants Bazza to win the derby, but he doesn&#8217;t want him to get the job?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what former Ibrox 5 game hero Bardsley had to say about Bazza&#8217;s chances:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Barry Ferguson is a huge character and he knows the club inside out, he has got the call to take the reins of the team and I think the players have the utmost respect for him.</p>
<p>They have that respect thanks to his achievements at the club and I think his character is a perfect fit for the club. There will be a transition period after Philippe Clement left, but they have gone back to basics and recent performances look to give them a ten times better chance in the O** F*** Derby against Celtic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that Phil got to know Bazza well during his 5 game stint at Ibrox back in the day.</p>
<p>Or more to the point, Bazza behavioural characteristics.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-after-a-bit-of-research-i-discovered-bardsley-was-also-a-naughty-boy-at-ibrox-during-the-ill-fated-paul-le-guen-experiment">After a bit of research, I discovered Bardsley was also a naughty boy at Ibrox during the ill-fated Paul le Guen experiment.</h3>
<p>He had a training ground bust-up with Le Guen, and was sent packing back to Manchester not long after.</p>
<p>A month later, Bazza of course, was stripped of the captaincy by Le Guen.</p>
<p>So I guess that Bazza and Phil were a bit of a thorn in Le Guen&#8217;s side back in 2006.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.readeverything.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2025/03/1278116383-1.jpg" alt="SNS Group/SNS Group/Getty Images" title="22/12/06 .Rangers Training .Murray Park - Glasgow.Frozen Out Rangers Defender Phil Bardsley, On Loan From Manchester Utd, Continues To Train With The Squad In The Hope Of A Return To The First Team" data-portal-copyright="SNS Group/SNS Group/Getty Images" data-image="80p3nc4xe2m9"></p>
<p>That&#8217;s how Bardsley knows that Bazza knows the club &#8220;inside out&#8221;.</p>
<p>For some strange reason though, Bardsley is touting Frank Lampard for the Ibrox job, and not Bazza:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Stranger things have happened in football than Frank Lampard going to R*****s. Frank had a tough time at Chelsea after Everton and some critics almost seemed to write him off, but since he has gone to Coventry he has been absolutely incredible and it just goes to show what can happen when you find that right fit.</p>
<p>You are never too far from finding that fit and sometimes it just takes the right club and the right players buying into the philosophy. When it comes to Lampard and R*****s, you just never know in football, that’s the beauty of it, not knowing what to expect next. But I’m delighted with his season so far because he is a really good guy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this speculation is very exciting, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>With Coventry City in fifth place in the EFL Championship, and occupying the play-off places, there&#8217;s a chance they could make the EPL this season.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-m-sure-frank-lampard-would-be-off-to-ibrox-if-he-managed-to-pull-off-a-feat-like-that">I&#8217;m sure Frank Lampard would be off to Ibrox if he managed to pull off a feat like that.</h3>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>The SMSM is just delighted to present these wonderful puff pieces to keep the gullibillies happy.</p>
<p>While they conveniently ignore that there was another £5.3 million emergency share issue yesterday.</p>
<p>Now one does wonder what really is going on while the Yanks are doing their due dilligence?</p>
<p>I mean I know they&#8217;re loaded and everything, but surely they&#8217;ll be wondering why they&#8217;ll have to pay whoever had these shares converted another £5.3 million on top of what they&#8217;re going to have to pay already?</p>
<p>To find out more about this story, you can read it over on <a href="https://videocelts.com/2025/03/blogs/latest-news/rangers-international-share-issue/">VideoCelts</a>.</p>
<p>Joe McHugh really explains it all rather well.</p>
<p>Such inconvenient truths are kept away from those poor bears.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t need to be reading things like that.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re in such a lofty position now, they can scoff at the idea of Jose Mourinho managing their club.</p>
<p>Cuz he&#8217;s shite, y&#8217;know?</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve proven that to the world.</p>
<p>By being world beaters again, of course.</p>
<p>Poor Celtic are in for it on Sunday.</p>
<p>You know, because now Bazza&#8217;s side is TEN times better than Phil Clement&#8217;s?</p>
<p>What a difference a couple of weeks makes!</p>

<p style="position: relative">This is the SFA&#8217;s way of giving us the two fingers.</p>
<p style="position: relative">We have been given the same on field referee as we had the day VAR Alan Muir decided to chalk off a perfectly legitimate goal.</p>
<p style="position: relative">McLean willingly accepted Muir&#8217;s call to disallow the goal, even though his call to award the goal should have been the final say on it.</p>
<p style="position: relative">The man in the VAR room next Sunday is the best referee in the land. </p>
<p style="position: relative">Well, in the eyes of the SFA and Willie Collum anyway.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Since he is somehow always involved on Derby day.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I don&#8217;t need to go into John Beaton and what we think of him as a referee.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I&#8217;ve done it enough times in the past.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-re-all-very-well-aware-of-john-beaton-s-history-in-this-fixture-and-it-rarely-favours-celtic-in-any-way" style="position: relative">We&#8217;re all very well aware of John Beaton&#8217;s history in this fixture, and it rarely favours Celtic in any way.</h3>

<p style="position: relative">For obvious reasons.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I knew Beaton would be involved in some capacity, and we all remember how he refereed our game against Hearts at Tynecastle from the VAR room last year.</p>
<p style="position: relative">We also remember how Brendan Rodgers was incredulous after his call to send Hyun-jun Yang off, as well as plenty of other inexplicable calls.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Here&#8217;s a reminder of what he said at the time:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote" style="position: relative">
<p>For John Beaton to actually look at that in VAR, supposedly under no pressure, and say that was a sending off, I find that incredible.</p>
<p>The second one (Hearts&#8217; penalty) is worse. If you have a penalty go against you for that then there will be penalties every single weekend and midweek. I don&#8217;t know what he (Iwata) is supposed to do. Tomo is jumping, he got a nudge, he is coming down, the ball falls on to his arm and there is no intention to move.</p>
<p>Then you get the penalty against and he gets the chance to look at it and see it. That really left us with an uphill task in the game but credit to my players, they kept going, their keeper has made a few good saves.</p>
<p>But it was a poor day for the officials. I try to respect decisions and give the benefit of the doubt, but when I see that level of incompetence, which is the only word I can use, then that makes me worry for the game.</p>
<p>In such a tight title race &#8211; which it is, and it&#8217;s fantastic to be involved in &#8211; that can make the difference. And that today made the difference for us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="position: relative">We&#8217;re also well aware of McLean&#8217;s allegiances, especially taking into consideration his brother played for the Ibrox club.</p>
<p style="position: relative">When we played Hibernian at Easter Road McLean made sure we never got into any kind of rhythm whatsoever.</p>
<p style="position: relative">He constantly blew his whistle for minor offences, ensuring the game was an extremely stop start affair.</p>
<p style="position: relative">There is no doubt he&#8217;ll do the same again next Sunday.</p>
<p style="position: relative">There&#8217;s also no doubting that Beaton will scrutinise everything to the nth degree.</p>
<p style="position: relative">If Celtic score a goal, every aspect and angle of the goal will be analysed.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Every bit of movement in the run up to it will be examined if an offside can&#8217;t be established.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-there-is-even-a-hint-of-a-foul-beaton-will-find-a-way-to-disallow-it" style="position: relative">If there is even a hint of a foul, Beaton will find a way to disallow it.</h3>
<p style="position: relative">I discussed in an <a href="https://readceltic.com/2025/03/10/keith-jackson-is-too-dumb-to-realise-that-pushing-barry-ferguson-for-the-ibrox-job-on-a-permanent-basis-plays-right-into-brendan-rodgers-and-celtics-hands/">article</a> yesterday that Barry Ferguson will have his players frothing at the mouth before they head out onto the Celtic Park turf.</p>
<p style="position: relative">He will instruct them to take chunks out of the Celtic players.</p>
<p style="position: relative">With the duo of officials in charge, chances are they will be allowed to do so with impunity.</p>
<p style="position: relative">But if any of the Celtic players return fire, well, you know what the outcome will be there.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Celtic fans can no longer be called paranoid after the revelation of Muir&#8217;s audio before disallowing our goal at Easter Road.</p>
<p style="position: relative">It is blatantly obvious he was looking for reasons to do so.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Even down to his coercion of the Assistant VAR.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I don&#8217;t doubt that Celtic will still have enough to beat the Ibrox side on Sunday next.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-the-task-has-just-been-made-that-bit-more-difficult-by-the-appointments-of-mclean-and-beaton" style="position: relative">But the task has just been made that bit more difficult by the appointments of McLean and Beaton.</h3>

<p style="position: relative">This is what we get when our board refuses to speak out when it comes to scandalous decisions.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Scandalous decisions that cost us games.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Just like Muir&#8217;s did at Easter Road a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p style="position: relative">What do we expect if we&#8217;re not willing to speak up about it?</p>
<p style="position: relative">The SFA are laughing at us, knowing full well we&#8217;ll say nothing.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Expect controversy in this derby, it&#8217;s inevitable.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Beaton and McLean will ensure it.</p>
<p style="position: relative">We&#8217;ll still win, but we&#8217;ll be made to work for it now.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Of that, you can be sure.</p>

<p style="position: relative">Jackson&#8217;s fawning in the media since Ferguson took the job on an interim basis has been off the charts.</p>
<p style="position: relative">It&#8217;s clear that when Ferguson was writing for the Record, they struck up a serious bromance.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Jackson can&#8217;t hide his admiration for Bazza in his Monday morning article in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-takeover-king-gets-close-34826237">Record</a> today.</p>
<p style="position: relative">He isn&#8217;t even trying to hide the fact that he&#8217;s desperate for Bazza to get the job on a full-time basis.</p>
<p style="position: relative">He&#8217;s too dumb to realise that this is playing right into Brendan Rodgers&#8217; and Celtic&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Jackson seems to think that because of his &#8216;jawdropping&#8217; (Keith still hasn&#8217;t picked his up off the floor yet, clearly) win over Fenerbahce that the former Ibrox skipper has announced himself as &#8216;genuine bona fide candidate for the position&#8217;.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Ferguson has been in charge for three games.</p>
<p style="position: relative">He won two and lost one.</p>
<h3 id="h-ferguson-is-now-being-hailed-as-some-sort-of-tactical-genius-for-the-way-he-beat-jose-mourinho-s-fenerbahce" class="wp-block-heading" style="position: relative">Ferguson is now being hailed as some sort of tactical genius for the way he beat Jose Mourinho&#8217;s Fenerbahce.</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="Fenerbahce SK v Rangers FC - UEFA Europa League 2024/25 Round of 16 First Leg" src="https://cdn.readeverything.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2025/03/2204040330.jpg" alt="Ahmad Mora - UEFA/UEFA/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Ahmad Mora - UEFA/UEFA/Getty Images" data-image="eyj8ek4pvy4z" /></p>
<p style="position: relative">Nobody seems willing to acknowledge that Fenerbahce were absolute shite on the night, and that Mourinho is a has been.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I acknowledged it after the game on Thursday, but nobody in the media has really attempted to call it out properly.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Bar <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bold-rangers-prediction-colleagues-sniggering-34822109">Hugh Keevins</a>, who erased any credibility in doing so by declaring that the Ibrox side were headed for the Europa League final again.</p>
<p style="position: relative">The media also sees this tie now as a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p style="position: relative">You&#8217;d be hard pressed to disagree on that point, based on the way Fenerbahce played at home, but the tie is not over.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Until it&#8217;s over.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Mourinho will throw everything at it in an attempt to save his ailing managerial career.</p>
<p style="position: relative">But even the most optimistic &#8216;neutral&#8217; out there will not be holding out hope that he can turn it around.</p>
<p style="position: relative">For the likes of Keith Jackson though, it&#8217;s done and dusted, and bring on Celtic next Sunday.</p>
<p style="position: relative">If his buddy Barry can win that one, then he&#8217;s a dead cert for the Ibrox job.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Surely?</p>
<p style="position: relative">However, there&#8217;s one thing Jackson is not factoring into all of this, Brendan Rodgers is not Jose Mourinho.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Brendan Rodgers is the man who came within 30 seconds of beating Bayern Munich on their own patch a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<h3 id="h-mourinho-might-have-been-schooled-by-barry-ferguson-tactically-brendan-rodgers-however-is-a-completely-different-proposition" class="wp-block-heading" style="position: relative">Mourinho might have been schooled by Barry Ferguson tactically, Brendan Rodgers however, is a completely different proposition.</h3>
<p style="position: relative">If anybody thinks he&#8217;ll come to Celtic Park and school Rodgers like he did Mourinho, I&#8217;d say think again.</p>
<p style="position: relative">It is hilarious that Jackson is desperate for Barry Ferguson to get the Ibrox gig on a full-time basis.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Bring it on is all I say.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Somehow though, I don&#8217;t see the Yanks seeing it that way.</p>
<p style="position: relative">As we all know, things at Ibrox have a tendency to fall flat on their face, so there&#8217;s no telling what might happen next Thursday night.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I certainly don&#8217;t think Fenerbahce will come, roll over, and have their bellies tickled, there might be some life left in the old dog that is Mourinho yet.</p>
<p style="position: relative">We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p style="position: relative">But to expect Ferguson to come to Celtic Park and beat us, and outsmart Brendan Rodgers tactically?</p>
<p style="position: relative">It really shows us how carried away Keith Jackson is getting.</p>
<p style="position: relative">I&#8217;m not saying they won&#8217;t put it up to us.</p>
<h3 id="h-there-s-no-doubt-bazza-will-have-them-frothing-at-the-mouth-and-wound-to-the-hilt-before-they-enter-the-field-of-play-but-that-will-play-into-our-hands-completely" class="wp-block-heading" style="position: relative">There&#8217;s no doubt Bazza will have them frothing at the mouth, and wound to the hilt before they enter the field of play, but that will play into our hands completely.</h3>

<p style="position: relative">I decided not to take his article apart today as there&#8217;s just too much in it to ridicule, but there is one particular segment that had me wailing with laughter.</p>
<p style="position: relative">And I will say to Keith&#8217;s credit, he is hilarious at times, in fact I questioned whether he was a comedian of a journalist in an <a href="https://readceltic.com/2025/03/03/is-keith-jackson-a-comedian-or-a-journalist-this-celtic-blogger-is-is-struggling-to-figure-out-which/">article</a> last week.</p>
<p style="position: relative">It&#8217;s hard to tell sometimes, have a look at this and you&#8217;ll see what I mean:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote" style="position: relative"><p>For him and his right hand men, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-mccann">Neil McCann</a>, Billy Dodds and Allan McGregor, it’s all very much about what they can achieve in the here and the now. It’s reasonable to assume they will have been shocked by much of what they have seen since returning to the inside of a club they knew so well as players.</p>
<p>The accepted standards of behaviour and professionalism which they once took for granted around Auchenhowie have long since been eroded.</p></blockquote>
<p style="position: relative">The first part paints a picture that Philippe Clement walked into Ibrox and took a flame thrower to the place.</p>
<p style="position: relative">The second part though?</p>
<p style="position: relative"><em>The accepted standards of behaviour and professionalism??</em></p>
<p style="position: relative">Let&#8217;s talk about standards and behaviour then.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Effectively taking backhanders through the EBT scheme and cheating the Her Majesty out of her well earned tax revenue?</p>
<h3 id="h-that-s-not-the-standard-of-behaviour-one-expects-from-the-players-of-an-institution-that-reveres-the-royal-family-and-drinks-from-the-loving-cup-is-it" class="wp-block-heading" style="position: relative">That&#8217;s not the standard of behaviour one expects from the players of an institution that reveres the Royal family and drinks from the loving cup, is it?</h3>
<p style="position: relative">Partaking in cheating on an industrial scale for almost ten years?</p>
<p style="position: relative">Is that an accepted standard of professionalism?</p>
<p style="position: relative">Of course in Keith&#8217;s book that never happened.</p>
<p style="position: relative">It&#8217;s been airbrushed out of history.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Just like the Bellshill billionaire with wealth off the radar has been airbrushed, conveniently, out of history.</p>
<p style="position: relative">We don&#8217;t need to remember insignificant things like that now, do we?</p>
<p style="position: relative">Personally, I really do hope that Barry Ferguson and his team of ex-Ibrox legends land the job on a permanent basis.</p>
<p style="position: relative">However, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s wishful thinking on my behalf.</p>
<p style="position: relative">It would be too good to be true.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Brendan Rodgers would add all of their heads to his Ibrox collection, and it wouldn&#8217;t take very long.</p>
<p style="position: relative">One can dream though.</p>
<p style="position: relative">Thanks Keith.</p>
