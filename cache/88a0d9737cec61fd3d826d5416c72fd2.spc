Alongside his wide and varied acting career, Frank also hosts acting masterclasses and life coaching sessions inspired by his work with legendary acting coach Bernard Hiller. 
Frank is also the founder of The WanderBhoys, a charity group who undertake bucket list challenges to raise funds for Celtic FC Foundation.
The WanderBhoys’ next challenge will see them spend several days trekking the Great Wall of China in April 2026 and they are looking for supporters to join them for what promises to be a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
The cost of the trip is £2,995 per person and each participant is also tasked with raising a minimum of £1,000, as a charitable contribution to Celtic FC Foundation.

From scaling the heights of the music industry in the 80s with his band 'It Bites' and touring the world with Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, to his more recent passions for Jungian psychology and astrology, Francis Dunnery has led a fascinating life that has taken him from a small village in Cumbria via Los Angeles and New York to his current family life in Connecticut, USA. The one constant through all of this, however, is his love for Celtic.
In this latest episode of the Official Celtic FC Podcast, Francis talks Gerry about his love for Celtic and how it evokes childhood memories of his late Scottish father and being brought up during the time of the Lisbon Lions.
Francis also performs an exclusive acoustic version of his song 'Through My Father's Eyes' which pays homage to those people who pass the Celtic traditions down through each generation.

As well as being a rollercoaster 10 years for the Celts, the '30s was also a period in the club's history which saw the legendary Jimmy McGrory cement his place as the greatest goalscorer ever to pull on the famous green and white hoops.

Anthony ‘The Andytown Apache’ Cacace, hailing from Andersonstown in Belfast, won the IBO super-featherweight title against Michael Magnesi in 2022 before adding a second world title to his name by defeating Joe Cordina to claim the IBF super-featherweight crown. 
The Apache’s victory against Cordina came on the undercard of the massive Tyson Fury v Oleksandr Usyk fight in Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and the Belfast fighter reflects on that night and the work that he put in to become a world champion.
Cacace made boxing history by becoming the first Irish super-featherweight world champion and he opens up about that achievement and what it means to have created a legacy by fulfilling his ultimate ambition.

Lubo spent four seasons with the Celts and throughout that time he cemented his reputation as a modern day Celtic great who had an abundance of talent and the ability to swing any match in Celtic’s favour. 
Ahead of the Hoops’ Champions League clash with Slovan Bratisla, the former Slovakian internationalist shared his thoughts on how he thinks the match will pan out and revealed who he’ll be supporting on the night. 
‘The Gift from God’ also spoke about his remarkable playing career which ranged from playing for his hometown team to pulling on the hoops and playing on the biggest stage in football. 
Lubo’s Celtic story began after he was signed by Jozef Venglos in 1998, and the former Celt opens up on his relationship with Dr Jo and shares the story of how the veteran Slovakian manager helped to shape his career from an early age. 
He also speaks about how Martin O’Neill helped him to realise a lifelong ambition of playing in the Champions League on a night that is etched in to Celtic folklore as the Bhoys defeated Juventus 4-3 under the lights at Paradise.

Ahead of the Hoops’ Champions League clash with Slovan Bratisla, the former Slovakian internationalist shared his thoughts on how he thinks the match will pan out and revealed who he’ll be supporting on the night. 
‘The Gift from God’ also spoke about his remarkable playing career which ranged from playing for his hometown team to pulling on the hoops and playing on the biggest stage in football. 
Lubo’s Celtic story began after he was signed by Jozef Venglos in 1998, and the former Celt opens up on his relationship with Dr Jo and shares the story of how the veteran Slovakian manager helped to shape his career from an early age. 
He also speaks about how Martin O’Neill helped him to realise a lifelong ambition of playing in the Champions League on a night that is etched in to Celtic folklore as the Bhoys defeated Juventus 4-3 under the lights at Paradise.

On this episode, listen to our greatest ever captain, Billy McNeill, reflecting on his incredible career as both a player and a manager. 
Cesar made his Celtic debut on August 23, 1958 in a 2-0 victory over Clyde – the first of 790 appearances for the club and more than any other player in Celtic’s history.
In the course of that incredible playing career, he won nine league titles, seven Scottish Cups, six League Cups and, of course, the European Cup in 1967. 
And over his two spells as Celtic manager, he won four league titles, three Scottish Cups and one League Cup, including the unforgettable 1987/88 Centenary season double.
In this interview from 2004, Billy is interviewed by fellow Lisbon Lion, Jim Craig, and their rapport and friendship comes across wonderfully as Cesar shares stories and memories from his extraordinary career.

On this episode, listen to our greatest ever captain, Billy McNeill, reflecting on his incredible career as both a player and a manager. 
Cesar made his Celtic debut on August 23, 1958 in a 2-0 victory over Clyde – the first of 790 appearances for the club and more than any other player in Celtic’s history.
In the course of that incredible playing career, he won nine league titles, seven Scottish Cups, six League Cups and, of course, the European Cup in 1967. 
And over his two spells as Celtic manager, he won four league titles, three Scottish Cups and one League Cup, including the unforgettable 1987/88 Centenary season double.
In this interview from 2004, Billy is interviewed by fellow Lisbon Lion, Jim Craig, and their rapport and friendship comes across wonderfully as Cesar shares stories and memories from his extraordinary career.

On this episode, Matthew Campbell is joined by Hugh Phillips, a former Celtic FC stadium tour guide and a lifelong Celtic supporter. 

Hugh, who hails from Burnbank, the birthplace of Jock Stein, speaks about his memories as a Celtic supporter which range from the 1955 Scottish Cup final to partying as the Celts won the European Cup and much more. 

Hugh hung up his club tie and blazer a few years ago, but his memories of working as a stadium tour guide are as vivid as ever, and he shares his fascinating stories from his time working behind the scenes at Celtic, which include meeting Henrik Larsson and having his tours hijacked by Lisbon Lion, Bertie Auld!

Hugh, who hails from Burnbank, the birthplace of Jock Stein, speaks about his memories as a Celtic supporter which range from the 1955 Scottish Cup final to partying as the Celts won the European Cup and much more. 

Hugh hung up his club tie and blazer a few years ago, but his memories of working as a stadium tour guide are as vivid as ever, and he shares his fascinating stories from his time working behind the scenes at Celtic, which include meeting Henrik Larsson and having his tours hijacked by Lisbon Lion, Bertie Auld!

 Dante and Jools are also East End Bhoys, born and brought up in the Calton, and their love of Celtic remains as strong as ever. And, as always, they’re happy to pop into Paradise and chat about all things Celtic.

A hero of the Iceland Euro 2016 squad, Bjarnason reflects on his Hoops career and the one appearance he made in the first-team.
Despite the lack of first-team football, there are plenty of incredible stories about his time in Glasgow, from arriving as a teenager from Iceland and how he adapted.
He shares some funny stories about the dressing room he arrived in the Celtic reserves and the brutal realities of trying to break into Martin O'Neill's team.
There are tales about the big European nights he was part of under Gordon Strachan, his debut away to Hibs, and why he regrets leaving the club.

In this episode, he talks about his exit from Celtic Park and how he was enticed to sign for Sir Alex Ferguson's new-look Manchester United.
From there, he goes back over all the big moments from his United career from being the first player since George Best to score 20 goals in a season, to the 1990 FA Cup final and 1991 European Cup Winners Cup.
He then details how Manchester United became the dominant force in the English Premier League as he gives some incredible insight on Sir Alex Ferguson's success and the dressing room.

The ex-Hibernian, Dundee United, West Bromwich Albion and Hoops players sits down to go through his football career and his time in the green and white in Glasgow.

Allan goes into detail about his much talked about move in the summer of 2015 from Hibs to Paradise before going through the highs and lows of his time under Ronny Deila and Brendan Rodgers.

He shares some amazing insight into how the Invincible Treble was won in the 2016/17 season and tells some superb teammate stories.

Allan also looks back on the rest of his footballing career and playing for the likes of Neil Lennon in Edinburgh, and what it was like to share a changing room with Nicolas Anelka at West Brom.

The ex-Hibernian, Dundee United, West Bromwich Albion and Hoops players sits down to go through his football career and his time in the green and white in Glasgow.

Allan goes into detail about his much talked about move in the summer of 2015 from Hibs to Paradise before going through the highs and lows of his time under Ronny Deila and Brendan Rodgers.

He shares some amazing insight into how the Invincible Treble was won in the 2016/17 season and tells some superb teammate stories.

Allan also looks back on the rest of his footballing career and playing for the likes of Neil Lennon in Edinburgh, and what it was like to share a changing room with Nicolas Anelka at West Brom.

Then, we go right into McCluskey's Celtic career as he shares some unbelievable tales of signing for the club under the legendary manager Jock Stein, as well as what it was like to play alongside the likes of Kenny Dalglish.
The former forward reflects on his incredible journey in the Hoops as he shares some brilliant stories about crucial league title wins and big goals in Europe against Real Madrid and Ajax.
Having played with and been managed by Tommy Burns, McCluskey has an endless supply of stories about the great man including how he got his famous nickname.

Having played with and been managed by Tommy Burns, McCluskey has an endless supply of stories about the great man including how he got his famous nickname.

After starting in huge wins over Barcelona and Rangers, a 20-year-old Kennedy then suffered a horrible knee injury on his Scotland debut against Romania which forced him out of first-team action until 2007, where he miraculously returned for the SPL title-winning match away to Kilmarnock.

Hear from him as he describes the severity of the injury for the first time, including how doctors had never seen anything like it in a football player.
There's also the full story of his early Hoops career, as he made his debut under Sir Kenny Dalglish to become the youngest-ever player at the age of 16.
He talks about the incredible time under Martin O'Neill and being involved in the side that featured the likes of Henrik Larsson and Lubomir Moravick.
There's also the inside on this current group of Celtic players under the management of Brendan Rodgers and Kennedy, as he discusses the season so far in the Scottish Premiership and UEFA Champions League.

The former Aston Villa manager remembers his career, starting at St Mirren and Motherwell, before winning the UEFA Champions League with Borussia Dortmund.
He shares how his move to Paradise materialised and his huge goal against Rangers in the 1998 title-winning season in what he described as the most pressurised season in his career.
There's some amazing stories about how the team won the title, and he looks through the rest of his career including amazing Henrik Larsson and Bobo Balde stories.
Lambert also reflects on the current Celtic first-team under Brendan Rodgers, and he picks his ultimate footballer from the Hoops players he played with.

This week, former Celtic Youth Academy graduate Cillian Sheridan is in the studio to look back on his career at Paradise.

He charts his rise from a potential career in Gaelic football and Aussie rules football, to moving over the Irish Sea to Glasgow and Celtic.

From there, he shares some outstanding memories about his early days in the Celtic youth teams, with some brilliant stories from inside the dressing room.
Breaking into the first-team, Sheridan looks back on his time scoring goals at Celtic Park and playing against the likes of Manchester United in the Champions League. 

And it's not just his time at Celtic that he has some great stories about, as he has funny tales about his time playing in the likes of Cyprus and Bulgaria.

The Celts are looking to book their place in the Scottish Cup final and to look ahead we have former Celt Scott McDonald on the show.
McDonald brings his exclusive insight into the huge match at the national stadium and brings his own experiences of derby matches at that stadium.

He also looks back on the 2007/08 title-winning season, 15 years on from the third title in a row under Gordon Strachan.

This Thursday (April 27) is the date 15 years on from the Celts’ 3-2 derby win at Celtic Park where the Australian striker scored twice in a crucial victory, and he looks back on that moment and more.

There’s also all the round-up from the Celtic Women’s team and their incredible Scottish Cup semi-final win over Glasgow City, advancing to the final with a 1-0 result.

We look back on their huge result in what’s been a remarkable week for Fran Alonso’s team, following on from a 4-2 win over City and a 6-0 win away to Hearts.

McDonald brings his exclusive insight into the huge match at the national stadium and brings his own experiences of derby matches at that stadium.

He also looks back on the 2007/08 title-winning season, 15 years on from the third title in a row under Gordon Strachan.

This Thursday (April 27) is the date 15 years on from the Celts’ 3-2 derby win at Celtic Park where the Australian striker scored twice in a crucial victory, and he looks back on that moment and more.

There’s also all the round-up from the Celtic Women’s team and their incredible Scottish Cup semi-final win over Glasgow City, advancing to the final with a 1-0 result.

We look back on their huge result in what’s been a remarkable week for Fran Alonso’s team, following on from a 4-2 win over City and a 6-0 win away to Hearts.

Signing in 2011, the Kenya international helped the Celts to two Scottish Premiership titles, one Scottish Cup and a historical run to the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League.

Wanyama hilariously reflects back on those memories, including his own big moments with goals against the likes of Hearts and Barcelona, while he remember his time playing in the Glasgow derby against Rangers.

Wanyama also speaks about current Celt, Alistair Johnston, who he helped persuade to the club.

Wanyama also speaks about current Celt, Alistair Johnston, who he helped persuade to the club.

After winning eight league titles in eight seasons, plus four Scottish Cups and four League Cups, Lustig returned to Glasgow and Celtic Park for the first time since leaving in 2019.

The former Sweden international sits down to reflect on his incredible career at Celtic, sharing some brilliant dressing room stories from the Champions League campaigns and about his teammates.

He also looks ahead to May’s special night at the OVO Hydro with Scott Brown, with tickets still available.

The podcast also brings you all the latest from inside Paradise, as the team reflects on Saturday’s 3-1 victory over Hibernian.

It was a match full of talking points and the team get stuck into a debate on VAR and talk about Hyeongyu Oh’s dramatic winner.

There’s also more from the women’s team after they reached the Scottish Cup semi-finals with a 5-1 win over Hearts.

Five goals from five different scorers kept the Hoops nine points clear at the top of the table and it also brought up 250 goals since the manager has arrived.

On this week’s Celtic View Podcast, Ryan Maher and Paul Cuddihy look back on the victory in Paisley and then take a look at the best of the 250 goals so far.

You have your say as well, as the podcast asked you for your favourites and we try to decide which goal is number one.
There’s also all the build-up to a double header against Hearts this week in the league and Scottish Cup. To get ready for the cup clash, we look back on four Scottish Cup classics between the team.

We then bring you a sneak peek of our upcoming podcast with former Celtic Youth Academy graduate Ross Wallace who shares the best stories from his time at Paradise, with the full interview out later this week.

There’s also all the updates from the women’s side and B team.

To get in the mood for the big tie, the Celtic View Podcast has two special podcasts this week, reflecting on our previous two League Cup final victories over Rangers.

On Friday, Ryan Christie of Bournemouth and Kris Ajer of Brentford reflect on the 2019 victory.

In this episode, B team coaches Darren O’Dea and Stephen McManus look back on the 2009 final, where goals from O’Dea and Aiden McGeady allowed McManus to lift the trophy up the steps at Hampden Park.

The former title winning captain reflects on Ange Postecoglou’s sides 2-0 victory over Kilmarnock in the League Cup semi-final, and looks ahead to the Glasgow derby in the final.

Lambert is full of praise for the current team and he shares his thoughts on the job the manager is doing and what he thinks the team can achieve over the second-half of the season.

A treble-winner at Celtic, Lambert also looks back on his own time at the football and shares some brilliant stories of the big games he played in and the players he shared the dressing room with.

With 2023 being 25 years since the 1998 title-winning campaign, and 20 years since the UEFA Cup final run, Lambert reflects on his memories of those two memorable campaigns.

He also takes some of your fan questions, which brings out a hilarious story about Henrik Larsson and their famous pool games.

The 23-year-old also looks back on a dream debut, answers your fan questions and takes part in our 60-second quick-fire quiz.
There's plenty to discuss in the studio as the team reflects on the 3-0 win over Livingston that was capped by Greg Taylor's goal in his 100th appearance.

There's also all the chat ahead of a busy week with the Celts taking on Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in the Champions League on Wednesday, before hosting Dundee United in the league on Saturday. 
Ryan Maher and Paul Cuddihy also review and preview the action for the B team and women's team, before rounding off on their weekly predictions games, as they try and predict the scores to seven fixtures and find out who comes out on top at the end of the season.<p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

His latest project, a documentary named Noteworthy, available now on BBC iPlayer, sees Chris touring Scotland in a bid to learn more about the faces that feature on our currency.

At the end of his journey, Chris crafts his own banknote, and, while we won’t spoil who made the final cut, it did get us thinking – which Celtic legends would the man himself vouch for if he were to create a Hoops-inspired banknote?

“On the front of a note, you need to just have one person’s face,” said Chris this week's episode of the official Celtic View podcast. “On the front, I’ll have Jock Stein. We’ll have a nice portrait of him on the front.

“On the back, I’ll go for… it’s got to be Billy McNeill. Get a picture of him in there, holding the European Cup up over his head. And then, on either side of him, I think I’ll pick two players from my time watching as a fan, so two of our more recent players. On one side of Billy, it’ll need to be Henrik Larsson, and then I’ll go for Scott Brown on the other side.”

In Noteworthy, Chris’ end product takes the form a seven-pound note. With this is mind, his hypothetical Celtic-inspired currency is worth an impressive £67.

At the end of his journey, Chris crafts his own banknote, and, while we won’t spoil who made the final cut, it did get us thinking – which Celtic legends would the man himself vouch for if he were to create a Hoops-inspired banknote?

“On the front of a note, you need to just have one person’s face,” said Chris this week's episode of the official Celtic View podcast. “On the front, I’ll have Jock Stein. We’ll have a nice portrait of him on the front.

“On the back, I’ll go for… it’s got to be Billy McNeill. Get a picture of him in there, holding the European Cup up over his head. And then, on either side of him, I think I’ll pick two players from my time watching as a fan, so two of our more recent players. On one side of Billy, it’ll need to be Henrik Larsson, and then I’ll go for Scott Brown on the other side.”

In Noteworthy, Chris’ end product takes the form a seven-pound note. With this is mind, his hypothetical Celtic-inspired currency is worth an impressive £67.
