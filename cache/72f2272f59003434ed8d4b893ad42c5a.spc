<p>Around 10am it seems that a major operation was carried out on London Road that detained 90 fans from the Green Brigade with knock on effects for thousands of Celtic supporters.</p>
<p>That major route to the stadium was blocked off, cars and buses had to find alternative routes with many supporters arriving in the stadium after the match had kicked off.</p>
<p>Tensions between the Green Brigade and the club have been high in recent weeks following SPFL sanctions over Pyro, the club statements on banners and the refusal for a pre-match Tifo at yesterday’s match.</p>
<p>In more general terms agreeing to away fans returning to the Derby fixture hasn’t gone down well with large sections of the Celtic support while the silence over Alan Muir makes the club look weak and compliant.</p>
<p>When you mix those factors in with an appalling display from the team culminating in a late defeat there was plenty of hostility to a tweet from John Paul Taylor, the club’s Supporters Liaison Officer.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">To clarify, I attended the incident in London Rd today from 12:25 where I liaised between PS and fans who were being held. I remained on London Rd as n this capacity until 14:10. I have since passed on my feedback to the Club</p>

<p>Publication of the feedback and a reaction from the board would go a long way to allaying the suspicions of many supporters, mostly Season Ticket holders.</p>
<p>There are a few areas between Parkhead Cross and the north-east entrances to the stadium where full searches for Piro could have been carried out with much less disruption, it seems that the Piro searches of away fans at the match were less successful.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that relations between supporters and the club are at a low ebb, the Green Brigade and the Board of Directors view each other with suspicion.</p>
<p>This isn’t new.</p>
<p>Last season the Green Brigade section was empty with the stadium near silent as Hearts won at Celtic Park.</p>
<p>In season 21/22 there was a 30 minute silent protest as Ange Postecoglou’s side drew 0-0 at home with Livingston.</p>
<p>Going further back there was serious crushing at the 2 September 2018 Glasgow Derby, the first where the away allocation was reduced from 7,000 to 800.</p>
<p>On that occasion the initial reaction of the <a href="https://www.celticfc.com/news/14887" target="_blank" rel="noopener">club</a> was met with a massive wave of hostility.</p>
<p><em><strong>CELTIC Football Club have issued the following statement following today&#8217;s game at Celtic Park.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We are aware of the issues caused by congestion prior to kick-off. We are pleased that stewards and police were able to assist quickly and we thank our supporters for their patience shown while the matter was being dealt with.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We will work closely with police to investigate and review this matter. The safety of our supporters will always be our priority.</strong></em></p>
<p>Seventeen hours later <a href="https://www.celticfc.com/news/14891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the club</a> performed a 180 degrees turn as the extent of the crushing became known:</p>
<p><em><strong>CELTIC Football Club today issued the following statement with regards to events prior to Sunday’s match at Celtic Park.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>‘The safety of our fans will always be of paramount importance and this is a matter which we are treating with the utmost seriousness. The Club, along with Police Scotland, will be investigating this matter fully to identify the causes and take the appropriate steps to ensure this does not happen again at Celtic Park. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Club and Police Scotland will advise of the outcome of this investigation once it is complete.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We are fully aware of the serious difficulties which arose yesterday for supporters, and we sincerely regret and apologise that so many fans were faced with this situation.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Yesterday’s match was the first occasion which featured new segregation and access arrangements.  </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Our total focus now is to work with the Police in looking at these arrangements and other circumstances surrounding this particular fixture and to take the correct action to ensure this situation is never repeated. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Our priority will always be to ensure our supporters enjoy a safe and positive experience at Celtic Park. We will be doing all we can to make sure this continues to be the case at all times.</strong></em></p>
<p>The findings of the September 2018 were never made public, it is unlikely that the club will comment on yesterday’s events as they celebrate St Patrick’s Day across their social media channels.</p>

<p>Brendan Rodgers and the players take a large share of the blame but the tone is set at the top of the club. From the moment that the final whistle blew against YB Bern on January 22 the club has been on the beach, season over and congratulating each other and calculating the bonuses for success.</p>
<p>The players had barely reached the dressing room after the match when credible reports emerged from France that Kyogo Furuhashi was on his way to join Rennes, all of the details had been agreed between the two clubs and the player.</p>
<p>What a message, what a risk to take with Kyogo the first choice striker for a pivotal Champions League tie, as he had been all season.</p>
<p>Rather than strengthening the first team squad Nicholson was cashing in, selling off assets. No doubt with the full support of the Chairman, the Board and the Non-Executive Director with the largest individual shareholding in the club.</p>
<p>A place in the Champions League Play Offs had been secured, there was a double digit lead in the SPFL with the League Cup already secured.</p>
<p>Rather than kick-on from that position Nicholson showed the same attitude as his mentor by effectively shutting up shop, cashing in the chips and getting out while ahead.</p>
<p>Kyogo was sold, two of Mark Lawwell’s disastrous summer 2023 signings were sent out on loan as was Stephen Welsh while Dane Murray was recalled from Queens Park to stew on the sidelines. Alexandro Bernabei was sold for a modest profit having fallen well short on expectations.</p>
<p>Incoming Celtic picked up Jota from the discussions with Rennes, a back up left back well into his thirties was secured with a pre-contract deal to sign Kieran Tierney completed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8545 size-large" src="https://celtic365.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SCUP_ABERDEEN_CELTIC_0455-1024x864.jpg" alt="Lennon, Lawwell, McGowan, Nicholson" width="1024" height="864" /></p>
<p><strong>During 2024 Celtic lost two competitive matches. In mid-March 2025 they have lost five, three in the SPFL and twice in the Champions League.</strong></p>
<p>Complacency is the biggest fear of genuine football people. It has to be guarded against at all cost, when it sets in it is a virus that destroys all of the good work previously carried out.</p>
<p>Complacency is alive and well inside Celtic, it is thriving. The SPFL title is assured, the Scottish Cup looks likely but recent form has been patchy culminating in today&#8217;s defeat to a team managed by Barry Ferguson.</p>
<p>The sale of Kyogo and failure to sign an equivalent striker fell short of the manager&#8217;s expectations. Since then two SPFL matches have been lost, the performances, even while scoring five goals against Aberdeen and St Mirren raised concerns if your expectations are set slightly higher than the domestic backwater.</p>
<p>Players know about complacency. They know what went on with Kyogo, the real reasons that he was sold. Their agents have been given plenty of notice to work on summer moves, Celtic are likely to decline to a place where they are more comfortable. Edging things in Scotland while telling themselves that progress in Europe is a step too far, it involves some hard work and requires more than accountants and lawyers.</p>
<p>Any pretence of building a club competitive in Europe has been binned, this season is the high water mark. Followed by attempts to sell off as many players as they can get away with.</p>
<p>Retain enough to stay just ahead of their O** F*** rivals, the club that lost to Queens Park in the Scottish Cup and looking to cut 25-30% off their wage bill.</p>
<p>It is a risky ‘policy’ but one that Rodgers is familiar with.</p>
<p>When you switch from John McGinn to Youssuf Mulumbu it sends out a signal. Following that up by signing Emilio Izaguirre, Oli Burke, Marian Shved, Vako Bayo and Jeremy Toljan tells a story.</p>
<p>Season 2018/19 was very successful for the CEO who was rewarded with payments of £3,549,026 on a turnover of £83.4m.</p>
<p>Eliminating complacency when the same central figures remain in place is almost impossible, when the summer transfer window opens we will see clearly the lie of the land.</p>
<p>Thursday nights in the Europa League and a nip and tuck race for the SPFL Premiership title will certainly carry a lot of appeal for the Board of Directors that promoted the utterly underwhelming Nicholson into his current role.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Bitter Boyd books holiday to miss Sky Sports celebrating Celtic&#8217;s 55 title celebration</h1>

<p><strong>Kris Boyd has booked the weekend of April 5 and 6 off from Sky Sports.</strong></p>
<p>The fun loving Sky Sports pundit fears that will be when Celtic will again be crowned as SPFL Premiership champions.</p>
<p>Winning their next three matches will ensure a title party, win their next two and Barry Ferguson’s side will have to win at Dundee and at home to Hibs to delay the inevitable.</p>
<p>To the outside, sane world it will be just another title for Celtic but for folk like Boyd this one carries extra significance/misery.</p>
<p>Since 2012 the lies got bigger. Already this season The World’s Most Successful Club myth has been dismantled, less than six months after that blow the number 55 will be getting used much less frequently.</p>
<p>From their arrival in the SPFL Premiership for the 2015/16 season the Tribute Act were banging on about 55, a number of no significance anywhere in the sporting world.</p>
<p>50  is a landmark, 60 less so, 10 is notable but 55? No one cared or cares but if that lot want to make a song and dance over 55, if they want to trash Glasgow city centre, if they want to vandalise statues over that number then it is only right to throw it back in their faces with interest. Boyd’s face in particular.</p>
<p>Back in 2016 he was still double dunting, lumbering around the pitch trying to score his second career goal against Celtic while climbing the ladder at Sky Sports.</p>
<p>Explaining a 5-1 defeat at Celtic he clutched at the comfort blanket that if Barrie Mackay had scored it would have been very different.</p>
<p>Celtic fans laughed at Boyd, they’ve been laughing ever since with the exception of the Phantom Season when strange things went on with testing, when bears weren’t allowed in to Ibrox to hurl abuse at Captain Disappointed and the Serial Losers.</p>
<p>That season was the highlight of Boyd’s broadcasting career, the four years since have been one long, never ending nightmare of Celtic successes, there is a better than even money chance that this season will finish up with the hoops celebrating a sixth treble in nine seasons.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>30 minutes 20 seconds</strong></p>
<p><strong>Boyd:</strong> If they both keep winning (Celtic winning Sunday’s Derby) it will be St Johnstone, I’ve already</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Duncan:</strong> Are you taking that weekend off?</p>
<p><strong>Boyd:</strong> I’ve already put in for that weekend off. Yeah, 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> of April, do you think that I want to listen to you (turning to Sutton), you might need that cardboard cut out again! Yes, 6<sup>th</sup> of April I’m off, I’m off, I’ve already sorted it, I’m off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16213 size-large" src="https://celtic365.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/LC_CELTIC_RANGERS_5002-1024x603.jpg" alt="Celtic, SSB, Boyd" width="1024" height="603" /></p>
<p>Boyd should be in place at Celtic Park on Sunday, probably alongside any two from James McFadden, Stan Petrov and Neil Lennon who all know the buttons to press with their colleague.</p>
<p>After a Derby victory Boyd’s post match meltdown is always a highlight for Celtic fans, no matter how jovial he is in the build up losing at Celtic Park surrounded by gloating Celtic supporters and employees is just too much.</p>
<p>His voice gets higher and higher, the other pundits just need to drop in a comment or two and off he goes into classic Boyd mode demanding  a complete turnover of everything at Ibrox, except his wee Monster Munch buddie, Barry.</p>
<p>Sunday’s Derby match is just a warm-up event for Sky Sports but if Celtic win the pain will continue for Boyd, it’ll be 13 days later before they return to action away to Dundee where Billy Dodds can expect a hot reception having voted against a CVA trying to force another of his former clubs into liquidation.</p>
<p>On Monday Boyd will be required by Sky Sports and The Sun for a video interview from his padded cell, the gags are unlikely to be flowing as that dreaded number of 55 comes into sight for Scotland’s Most Successful Club.</p>

Yes, 6<sup>th</sup> of April I’m off, I’m off, I’ve already sorted it, I’m off.</p>

<p>Boyd should be in place at Celtic Park on Sunday, probably alongside any two from James McFadden, Stan Petrov and Neil Lennon who all know the buttons to press with their colleague.</p>
<p>After a Derby victory Boyd’s post match meltdown is always a highlight for Celtic fans, no matter how jovial he is in the build up losing at Celtic Park surrounded by gloating Celtic supporters and employees is just too much.</p>
<p>His voice gets higher and higher, the other pundits just need to drop in a comment or two and off he goes into classic Boyd mode demanding  a complete turnover of everything at Ibrox, except his wee Monster Munch buddie, Barry.</p>
<p>Sunday’s Derby match is just a warm-up event for Sky Sports but if Celtic win the pain will continue for Boyd, it’ll be 13 days later before they return to action away to Dundee where Billy Dodds can expect a hot reception having voted against a CVA trying to force another of his former clubs into liquidation.</p>
<p>On Monday Boyd will be required by Sky Sports and The Sun for a video interview from his padded cell, the gags are unlikely to be flowing as that dreaded number of 55 comes into sight for Scotland’s Most Successful Club.</p>
<p>Boyd expects Sunday&#8217;s Derby to finish as a draw.</p>

<p>Nico Raskin, Ianis Hagi and the usual suspects were all out in force after the January fixture claiming that there wasn’t much between the two clubs despite the evidence of the SPFL Premiership table.</p>
<p>Celtic left Ibrox in January with their lead trimmed to 11 points, at kick-off time on Sunday they have a 16 point lead, goal difference advantage of 37 and a new manager to face, the third since Brendan Rodgers took over from Ange Postecoglou less than two years ago.</p>
<p>Sutton took to the old Glasgow Derby in an instant, scoring three minutes into his debut as a 6-2 home win turned the tide Celtic’s way, almost a quarter of a century on that situation has been reinforced multiple times over the club formed by Charles Green in 2012.</p>
<p>For almost a decade Sutton has observed a familiar pattern from the side-lines, noise from Ibrox matched by delivery, results and dominance from Celtic.</p>
<p>Joey Barton discovered that it wasn’t a wise move to noise up Brendan Rodgers and Scott Brown, following a six goal thriller his coffee machine was soon unplugged and returning to the backwater of Burnley.</p>
<p>Urged on by their media messengers trash talking is a constant from the 2012 Tribute Act with James Tavernier an expert at claiming how different things will be this time next year.</p>
<p>Sutton has heard it all from Kris Boyd, Grame Souness and a cast of thousands. The script rarely alters with the former Celtic striker sensing that his old club are ready to deliver a very significant message on Sunday.</p>
<p>Addressing the motivation for a squad of players 16 points clear with nine matches left to play Sutton told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/rangers-great-big-talk-every-34857017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Record</a>:</p>
<p><em><strong>It shouldn’t be hard to get up for this one no matter what. If I was in that dressing room I’d see this as a chance to bury Rangers and get the title in the bag as soon as possible.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>They will also be desperate to right a few wrongs from Ibrox at Christmas. That was Celtic’s poorest performance of the season and it just seemed to come completely out of the blue.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Back then Rangers were toiling and people were wondering how many they’d lose by. Instead, it was Philippe Clement’s last stand as his team ran riot. Fair play, they were terrific on the day and Celtic were way off it.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>You can forgive Celtic for that as those off days have been few and far between. Yet that is the kind of result and performance that sticks in the throat of Brendan Rodgers. You could see it at the weekend with his stuff about Rangers stealing Celtic’s game in Govan.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>He is rightly proud of his incredible derby record – and he’d love to put Rangers in their place again. This is the chance to make a statement, to show who is boss in Glasgow.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rangers are great at the big talk. They are always coming or back, or whatever. Celtic are the ones in pole position in the league and they will be out to show why.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>This reminds me a bit of the final derby of the 2003/04 season. We’d ran away with the league and there was seemingly nothing much to play in the last encounter at Celtic Park.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We’d beaten Rangers in all three previous league games and in the Scottish Cup and the title race was over. We treated it like a must win though. It was nice to seal it in style with a finish most people will agree was world class.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The long ball, the flick on to Henrik Larsson, taking the return, shrugging off Frank de Boer and then chipping Stefan Klos from 30 yards. To be honest, I think it was more me knowing my capabilities end not fancying attempting to dribble the ball in.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>It was my son Ollie’s birthday as well and it’s still known as his Green and White Wash birthday.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>No one can say that game was mea</strong><strong>ningless – even if the points at stake didn’t change much. These games are never dull regardless and it will be interesting to see how both sides approach it.</strong></em></p>
<p>Sutton stamped his name all over the Derby fixture despite being up against incentivised opponents lured to Ibrox by Dave Murray’s disguised remuneration scams.</p>
<p>For two and a half months Rodgers has had the Ibrox defeat hanging over him, Clement failed to last the distance but the opposition shirt is the same with Barry Ferguson’s side set to face the backlash for that bizarre day in January.</p>

<p>Almost four weeks later there has been little evidence to support the Records eye-catching headline. Instead, we have had conjecture and occasional frenzied speculation, apparently fuelled by leaks from non-attributable sources.</p>
<p>The only on-the-record (no pun intended) comment has come from Dave King and that seemed intended to manage expectations in a downward direction.</p>
<p>Cutting through the waffle it now appears that the would-be bid comes not from the San Francisco 49ers but from individuals with some sort of connection to them. The name of Leeds United is frequently mentioned but no one has quite been able to pin down the role of the Yorkshire club and what its relationship might be with its potential stable mate.</p>
<p>None of this has deterred the frenzied speculation amongst the denizens of Ibrox. Particular concerns have been around which world class manager will be chosen to lead the newly minted club, the size of the supposed “war chest” for the next transfer window and even the prospects for an Everton-style new stadium. Images of the new look 70,000 seater Ibrox Stadium have been all over social media with Apple the natural sponsor since they are short on publicity according to several Ibrox insiders.</p>
<p>As in 2011, when a Motherwell-born billionaire was cheered to the echo as he walked the length of Edmiston Drive, there appears to be an extreme lack of risk awareness as to potential downsides. For supporters who have historically prized the idea of owners who “get it” there’s a curious lack of concern about the precise identity of the supposed new owner or owners. And, more importantly, what their intentions might be for Scotland’s newest senior football club.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-17129 size-medium" src="https://celtic365.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Jackson-McDermott-300x191.png" alt="Jackson, Daily Record, Ibrox" width="300" height="191" /></p>
<p>And there is a conundrum at the heart of this story. What is the attraction of a business which has never made a profit for a worldwide sports group? Or anyone else for that matter? This is a matter that would undoubtedly have engaged the attention of any intelligent well-motivated sports or financial journalist or broadcaster. So, naturally in Scotland in 2025, no one in the media has paid it any attention whatsoever.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which a loss-making business can be of value to a potential bidder.</p>
<p>Bizarre as it may seem losses themselves can be valuable. The latest set of accounts from <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/39646iezddpk/37KyRFiANn2FDpsmhGzdVI/a63f0e1d2efdda456f299ad6225195e6/Rangers_Reports_and_Accounts_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rangers International Football Club</a> contains this nugget of information on Page 52:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><i>At the Balance Sheet date, the Group has unrecognised tax losses of £108.4 million creating an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £27.1 million (2023 &#8211; £95.8 million creating an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £23.9 million).</i></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Put simply this means that anyone who <strong><em><b><i>could</i></b></em></strong> run RIFC profitably could generate a surplus of £108.4m over the next few years without having to pay any tax. Or, to put it more starkly, Celtic will pay £27.1m on its next £108.4m profit. RIFC will pay no taxes whatsoever. <strong><u><b>(Editor’s Note: so what’s new?).</b></u></strong></p>
<p>And, where there is more than one company in a group, a tax loss in one company can be offset against taxable profits in other group companies. That is the principal attraction of football clubs for many conglomerates and was almost certainly a major factor in Lawrence Marlborough and then David Murray taking over the Ibrox franchise in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Despite the blanket coverage in the Record almost nothing is known of the intentions of the prospective bidders for Rangers. Douglas Park, a successful Lanarkshire based businessman hasn&#8217;t even been contacted for his thoughts on the hysteria sweeping through the Record Sports Desk and their colleagues across the river at BBC Scotland.</p>
<p>So, it is pointless to speculate on what might happen. But it is possible to figure out a theoretical business model which might make a loss-making football club seem like a prime attraction for a bidder or perhaps even a predator.</p>

<p>The replies piled in on Blow The Whistle, a very professional looking Twitter account.</p>
<p>It came just a few days after Willie Collum admitted that Alan Muir had no evidence to disallow a ‘goal’ from Daizen Maeda against Hibs on February 22. Had the laws of the game been applied correctly the scoreline would have been 2-2 in the 83<sup>rd</sup> minute. Celtic have only lost two matches this season.</p>
<p>Blow The Whistle earned plenty of traction with a detailed breakdown of how many fouls it takes for SPFL Premiership clubs to have a player booked, the results were stark, and sadly predictable as far as Celtic fans are concerned.</p>
<p>Despite dominating virtually every domestic match an incredible number of free kicks are awarded against Celtic.</p>
<p>Typically with 65% or more possession in a match Celtic will have more than half of the free kicks awarded against them.</p>
<p>It is a pattern repeated regardless of who is the referee.</p>
<p>In a bid to break up play and earn a breather opposing players fall to the ground whenever a Celtic player closes them down, most of the time the referee will oblige with a free kick.</p>
<p>That halts any momentum, allows opponents to regroup and breaks up the flow of the game, the statistics are overwhelming.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have access to all the stats but I&#8217;d guess that the majority of fouls awarded against Celtic are against the forwards, especially the wingers as Nicolas Kuhn and Maeda track back, Celtic&#8217;s defenders are rarely tested.</p>

<p>With Ange Postecoglou taking charge of Celtic in the summer of 2021 there was a big change in how the hoops played the game.</p>
<p>The new look side went to Aberdeen at the start of October looking for their first away win, they were up against a very formidable opponent in Bobby Madden who refereed the opening match of the season when Andy Halliday raked his studs down Callum McGregor’s calf without any card being shown. Halliday and Madden are top lads and podcast buddies.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/aberdeen-vs-celtic/stats/445320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky Sports</a> who covered the match Celtic had 61.4 possession but managed to commit 27 fouls during Aberdeen’s 38.6% of time on the ball.</p>
<p>Assuming a generous 60 minutes of the ball actually being in play fouls were awarded against Celtic basically every second minute. Jota was one of the worst offenders! Almost every time he approached Calvin Ramsey the Dons defender hit the deck, Madden obliged every time.</p>
<p>Aberdeen committed just 10 fouls. A foul every six minutes.</p>
<p>It is astonishing that a team with almost twice the amount of possession was fouling three times as frequently but as we’ve learned over recent seasons every effort is made by opponents and match officials to slow Celtic down. There are plenty of officials like Madden around.</p>
<p>In most home matches Celtic have 70-80% possession, almost as predictable the foul stats are much more even.</p>
<p>Beating <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cq8k91vx3j2t#MatchStats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dundee United</a> 3-0 last month the hoops had 76.1% possession but committed seven fouls compared to nine from the visitors.</p>
<p>Beating <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/czje9g4prv2t#MatchStats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aberdeen</a> 5-1 on February 25 Celtic had 69.2% possession but the foul count was eight against 13.</p>
<p>Referees are very, very willing to award free-kicks against Celtic but they don’t have the evidence to be handing out yellow cards.</p>
<p>Anyone looking for patterns in refereeing issues ought to start by looking at penalties conceded with one club managing runs of 69 and 73 SPFL Premiership matches without having a penalty awarded against them.</p>
<p>During his 10 months as manager, with Connor Goldson in the team Micky Beale didn’t have a single SPFL Premiership penalty awarded against his side.</p>

<p>Many fans would use different language to describe the performance of the man from the Crown Bar in Bellshill. Ever since Albion Rovers were denied a Scottish Cup victory at Ibrox in March 2014 the emerging referee from Lanarkshire has been ‘one for the watching’.</p>
<p>After the defeat at Tynecastle Rodgers spoke in measured tones, described the incidents and repeated the incompetence accusation in his post-match interviews with Sky Sports, BBC Scotland and the all in media conference.</p>
<p>Those comments earned Rodgers a one match touchline ban, he appealed against it unsuccessfully but refused to back down, there was no apology given to Beaton who had instructed Dozy Don Robertson to review a booking for Yang Hyun-jun that was upgraded to a red card then prompted a Hearts penalty for handball against Tomoki Iwata that even Steven Naismith couldn’t justify.</p>
<p>That match was the only domestic fixture in 2024 that Celtic lost.</p>
<p>Rodgers watched Celtic defeat Livingston from the stand at the Toni Macaroni Arena, he returned to work for the April 8 Derby match at Ibrox with Beaton refereeing the game as the SFA exacted revenge on the Irishman.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole saga Celtic said nothing, Mikey Nicholson hid in his office studying spreadsheets while working out what players he could sell off in the summer.</p>
<p>Since Rodgers made the incompetent claim about Beaton there has been seven Glasgow Derbies, on Sunday the man from the Crown Bar will be back on VAR duty- the fifth time in those seven fixtures that he has either been the match referee or VAR.</p>
<p>That is 71.4% of those matches. He was given time off for the final SPFL Premiership fixture of last season then for the most recent match at Ibrox after he had refereed the fixture in the first two clashes of the season.</p>
<p>You don’t need to dig too far for a pattern of decision making, it is similar to that of Alan Muir.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Rodgers' explosive press conference in FULL as he reckons Hearts defeat was 'decided' by officials" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RS4kG_wgB8g" width="824" height="487" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>I also think as well that VAR is not the problem here, that’s clear. It’s competence. And I think the first one is a great example of the game being refereed outside of the pitch. This is the thing everyone is talking about, that the officials do their job and if it’s something that’s clear and obvious maybe step in. The referee made the decision and someone outside made another decision to say it was a sending off. So that’s the game being refereed outside of the field and in big games that costs you.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I’m not one who comes crying about referees, be it here or the EPL, because I understand there will be mistakes made. But that today was awful officiating in what was a big game for us.</strong></em></p>
<p>Asked if it was the worst officiating that he had experienced in Scotland (which includes Beaton’s Alfredo Morelos masterclass at Ibrox in December 2018) the Celtic boss didn’t hesitate with his answer:</p>
<p><em><strong>I think so. In my time up here I’m not one to have a go at refs because I understand it’s a very very difficult position they are in. I try to respect decisions and give the benefit of the doubt.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>But I think when I see that level of incompetence is the only word I can use, then that makes me worry for the game. In such a tight title race, which it is and it’s fantastic and great to be involved in, that can make the difference. And that today made the difference for us.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>APRIL 8, 3-3 at Ibrox</strong></p>
<p>Beaton ignores a penalty box tag-team attack on Kyogo Furuhashi from Connor Goldson and Jack Butland that leaves the Celtic defender in a heap on the six yard line.</p>
<p>He misses a clear handball by Connor Goldson, VAR Nick Walsh relectantly get involves with Matt O’Riley scoring from the penalty spot.</p>
<p>After allowing 45 minutes of playacting from Fabio Silva go unpunished Beaton books the on loan Wolves forward for a dive. Walsh suggests a VAR review and suddenly it is Tavpen O’Clock.</p>
<p>Iwata is wiped out a few minutes later, play continues until Dessers finds the net, fortunately Walsh prompts Beaton into a review and the ‘goal’ is disallowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MAY 25, 1-0 Celtic in the Scottish Cup Final.</strong> Beaton on VAR duty.</p>
<p>Two clear Celtic penalty claims are ignored in the first half by referee Walsh, VAR checks are completed in 15 seconds.</p>
<p>In the first incident Ben Davies raises his hand to control the ball, in the second Davies pushes Leon Balogun into Kyogo as he prepares to shoot.</p>
<p>The VAR official that spotted Iwata’s handball at Tynecastle saw nothing wrong with either decision</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1 September, 3-0 at Celtic Park</strong></p>
<p>Celtic utterly dominate Phil Clement’s side, Andrew Dallas had the squiggly lines out to disallow a Kyogo ‘goal’ with the match scoreless but the hoops went in at the break leading 2-0, finishing the match 3-0 victors leaving the Belgian Beale scrambling around for comforting stats. No major controversies from Beaton other than breaking up Celtic’s play at every opportunity, full use of the Disadvantage Rule</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>15 December 3-3, League Cup Final</strong></p>
<p>Willie Collum showed his trust in Beaton by giving him successive Glasgow Derby appointments, showing the clear weakness of the newly installed Head of Refereeing.</p>
<p>Midway through the first half Jefte rankes his studs down the calf of Nicolas Kuhn but avoids a booking.</p>
<p>Leon Balogun was given licence to boot anything in green and white with Reo Hatate a particular target. After another attack on Cameron Carter-Vickers while on a yellow card the veteran defender was substituted in the 67<sup>th</sup> minute.</p>
<p>During extra-time Callum McGregor sent a quickly taken free kick through for Maeda to run onto with Clement’s defenders sleeping, fortunately Beaton blew his whistle and insisted on the free kick being retaken from virtually the same spot.</p>

<p>Thankfully for the Head of Refereeing at the SFA Kasper Schmeichel saved him from another scandal, this time involving the judgement of Nick Walsh.</p>
<p>On Friday the SFA finally released the evidence that Alan Muir overstepped the mark to wrongly disallow a ‘goal’ from Daizen Maeda away to Hibs. It wasn’t a factual overturn, it was the wish of the VAR official to deny Celtic a goal.</p>
<p>The long held suspicions of the Celtic support were confirmed, Muir has been left out of the last three rounds of fixtures.</p>
<p>During the four minutes of coverage on the VAR Review no explanation was offered for Muir’s behaviour, no consequences were discussed with nine rounds of SPFL Premiership fixtures to be covered with Muir one of three full-time officials on the SFA pay-roll.</p>
<p>This weekend Collum had four Scottish Cup ties over four days to monitor, all of the matches are going out live on television with Nick Walsh trusted with the top tie, Celtic v Hibs on Premier Sports on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Last season the Bearsden based school-teacher was regarded as Scotland’s top referee, taking charge of two of the five Glasgow Derbies including the Scottish Cup Final.</p>
<p>Eighteen minutes into yesterday’s match Walsh was almost facing his Alan Muir moment.</p>
<p>There seemed to be nothing brewing when Cameron Carter-Vickers cleared the ball out of play towards the Celtic dug-out. What happened next caught Walsh sleeping, he switched off, almost causing a goal that would have dominated the headlines.</p>
<p>Josh Campbell continued his run, saw a pitchside ball and quickly threw it into play more than 15 yards away from where the ball went out.</p>
<p>As the still image below shows Walsh had a perfect view of what was going on, allowed play to continue with Kieron Bowie racing in to fire a shot on goal that Schmeichel blocked at the expense of a corner.</p>
<p>The Celtic keeper let the referee know his feelings, the fans shouted their concern while Walsh breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>There is no mechanism through VAR to intervene if Bowie’s shot had gone into the net, a throw-in isn’t for VAR officials to judge on with the decision of the on-field official to stand.</p>
<p>By switching off for a few seconds Walsh was very nearly compromised, if Schmeichel hadn’t saved there would have been over 50,000 angry fans on the referees case just days after Muir’s actions had been exposed.</p>
<p>In a nightmare scenario for Collum the incident could have been next Sunday with Cyriel Dessers running through on goal to put the visitors 1-0 up. Perhaps that is going too far.</p>
<p>Walsh, John Beaton, Don Robertson and Steve McLean are the only current referees that have taken charge of the Glasgow Derby, McLean’s two appointments coming seven years apart.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning the SFA will announce the officials for next Sunday’s Derby clash, with the destination of the title virtually decided Collum would like to add a new name to the rota available for that match.</p>
<p>Matthew MacDermid was probably being earmarked for the match but was highlighted on the latest VAR Review show as having made two on pitch mistakes.</p>
<p>That leaves the way clear for David Dickinson to referee the match, on Facebook it is quite clear that his family all support that Ibrox Tribute Act.</p>
<p>Collum has a multitude of issues to deal with due to the shallow pool of talent available to him, on Sunday Schmeichel saved him from one more headache, bailing out the incompetence of Walsh.</p>

<p>For decades the paranoid card has been thrown at hoops supporters, with the release of the audio from Ester Road it is clear that fans weren’t paranoid enough.</p>
<p>The emotion and determination of Muir to disallow the ‘goal’ takes it way beyond Honest Mistake territory.</p>
<p>Only a complete idiot would believe that this is the first time that Muir has gone out of his way to defy the Laws of the Game in matches involving Celtic.</p>
<p>He first came to prominence at the 2015 Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness Caley Thistle, a decade later he is still going strong, now with the security of a full-time SFA salary.</p>
<p>As the newly appointed Head of Refereeing at the SFA one of Willie Collum’s first tasks was giving Muir a full-time VAR job, as a refereeing colleague for more than a decade Collum knows exactly what his mate Muir is.</p>
<p>Collum has been playing the media game all season, they praise him as a good honest guy but he is as much in the spotlight now as Muir.</p>
<p>Does he continue with a VAR official hell bent on giving the decision that he wants despite the warnings of his lesser qualified assistant (Ross McLeod) that the evidence isn’t there.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxVKVzcBqGg&amp;t=289s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VAR Review</a> Collum says:</p>
<p><em><strong>Let&#8217;s think what the starting point is? The starting point is the on-field decision. The on-field decision is the assistant referee keeps the flag down and a goal is scored.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>So, as far as the assistant referee is concerned, the ball has not gone out of play.  The VAR and AVAR of course go into a check, which they are expected to do so. They need to assess with the cameras and the footage available if the ball is out of play.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>You hear the VAR at one point say that it looks like it&#8217;s gone out of play from a particular angle, and then AVAR correctly says &#8216;I don&#8217;t think you can be conclusive there&#8217;.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Then an angle appears from the main camera and you hear a reaction, the VAR and AVAR both think at that point that&#8217;s evidence to say the ball is out of play.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>However, what I want to be very clear about, and we coach the VAR&#8217;s and AVAR&#8217;s to be certain about this, you need 100 per cent conclusive evidence to disallow the goal here and prove that the ball is over the goal line.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>And in this case, that is not possible. It&#8217;s not possible to prove categorically that the ball has crossed the goal line fully, because we know from previous examples at World Cup&#8217;s that a ball can look out from certain angles, but then when you look at the camera above &#8211; because in World Cup competitions there&#8217;s the spider cam and a clear camera on the goal line. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>A slight part, even a millimetre of the ball can be overhanging that goal line, and that&#8217;s enough to say that the ball is in play. It&#8217;s impossible to prove otherwise.</strong></em></p>
<p>Well Willie, you’ve left Muir out of two rounds of SPFL Premiership fixtures and the Scottish Cup quarter-finals, will you continue that or slip him back in hoping that none of the Internet Bampots will notice?</p>

<p>There is one other significant party involved in this issue- the board of Celtic, especially their CEO and Chairman.</p>
<p>Since July 2012 Celtic have barely raised a murmur of complaint against the SFA.</p>
<p>When on-line anger reaches a peak Peter Lawwell or Michael Nicholson will reach out for the Surprised and Disappointed Statement Template, shift the variables, click on publish then go to the back of the bus to stare at their brogues.</p>
<p>Once a year the board are questioned about their meek acceptance of anything thrown out by their friends at the SFA at the club AGM.</p>
<p>2021 Chairman Bankier claims that referees are a deep source of concern when questioned on Nick Walsh and Bobby Madden</p>
<p>2023 CEO Nicholson gives his penalty to Rangers gag when questioned on a John Beaton issue</p>
<p>2024 Nicholson compliments the SFA for the VAR Review bringing transparency to refereeing issues. He had been asked if he backed Brendan Rodgers calling Beaton incompetent after the match at Tynecastle in March 2024, the Celtic CEO refused to back the club manager.</p>
<p>The release of audio from Easter Road is certainly a game changer, it is no longer honest mistakes, this is fresh grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Ross Macleod</strong> (Assistant VAR): Potential ball out of play</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> Ball out of play</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> No, it is inconclusive</p>
<p><strong>Steven McLean:</strong> They will check it OK?</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> OK, checking onfield decision of goal</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> I don’t think that you can conclusively say that that’s out</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Any other angles</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> That’s not conclusive either</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> There!</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> Yeah, happy with that</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> We’re going to give a factual review here, overturn</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> And I want you to award a goal kick</p>
<p>Now that Muir has been outed the spotlight is on Collum and Nicholson. On past experiences both will attempt to sit it out, next weekend the Celtic CEO welcomes more than 2,000 Ibrox fans to the Glasgow Derby, complete with their songs of poison and hate that fly in the face of the Unacceptable Conduct regulations.</p>
<p>In three and a half years as CEO Nicholson hasn&#8217;t once raised his voice. On Wednesday and Thursday statements were issued criticising supporter behaviour, Celtic do love an easy target which is why Collum knows that he can count on the silent backing of Lawwell&#8217;s former sidekick that now draws a salary as CEO.</p>

<p>Today, almost two weeks after Brendan Rodgers claimed that he had guessed at a decision to disallow a ‘goal’ from Daizen Maeda the SFA confirmed that the Celtic boss called it right.</p>
<p>What next then for Muir?</p>
<p>Since he wrongly disallowed what would have been a Celtic equaliser at Easter Road he has been left out of two rounds of SPFL fixtures and this weekends four Scottish Cup ties.</p>
<p>The incident at Easter Road is bad enough but earlier this season he ‘missed’ a push on Maeda by Stephen O’Donnell that should have resulted in a penalty for Celtic. Muir did notice that the forward had put the ball in the net with his arm but failed to highlight the push.</p>
<p>With just three full-time VAR officials they are in demand for the high profile matches, Muir has been on duty at 6 of Celtic’s 29 SPFL matches, just over 20%.</p>
<p>The extent of the error at Easter Road is is one thing but hearing the audio is even more damning, he sounds like an opposition fan desperately trying to find something, anything to disallow the goal.</p>
<p>Finally he found the ‘evidence’ to back up his wish, from a camera on the 18 yard line looking through Alistair Johnston he found the conclusive angle that the ball was out.</p>
<p>Whether the ball was in or out is no longer an issue, the problem for Muir is that there absolutely wasn’t factual evidence that the ball had gone out of play.</p>
<p>On today’s VAR Review Collum admitted:</p>
<p><em><strong>Let&#8217;s think what the starting point is? The starting point is the on-field decision. The on-field decision is the assistant referee keeps the flag down and a goal is scored. So, as far as the assistant referee is concerned, the ball has not gone out of play. The VAR and AVAR of course go into a check, which they are expected to do so. They need to assess with the cameras and the footage available if the ball is out of play.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>You hear the VAR at one point say that it looks like it&#8217;s gone out of play from a particular angle, and then AVAR correctly says &#8216;I don&#8217;t think you can be conclusive there’. Then an angle appears from the main camera and you hear a reaction, the VAR and AVAR both think at that point that&#8217;s evidence to say the ball is out of play.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Now, what I want to be very clear about, and we coach the VAR&#8217;s and AVAR&#8217;s to be certain about this, you need 100 per cent conclusive evidence to disallow the goal here and prove that the ball is over the goal line. And in this case, that is not possible. It&#8217;s not possible.</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course Muir has plenty of previous for baffling decisions regarding Celtic, he has been watched closely since his Additional Assistant role in the 2015 Scottish Cup semi final defeat from Inverness Caley Thistle. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=josh+meekings+handball&amp;oq=josh+meeking&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgDEAAYgAQyCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyBwgBEC4YgAQyBggCEEUYOTIHCAMQABiABDIICAQQABgWGB4yCAgFEAAYFhgeMggIBhAAGBYYHjINCAcQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAgQABiGAxiABBiKBdIBCDkzNjlqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> &#8216;Josh Meeking handball&#8217; if you need a reminder</p>

<p>Discussing the Maeda penalty incident at Motherwell Collum had no defence for Muir’s decision to notice handball from the Celtic forward but not the push on him by Stephen O’Donnell.</p>
<p><em><strong>For us, this is not normal contact. We think the Celtic attacker is more ahead of the Motherwell defender. We think that is an arm movement by the Motherwell defender and also then causes a collision in the ground as well by the legs as well as the arm.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We think this should be a penalty kick. We want the referee to be brought to on-field review to award a penalty kick here.</strong></em></p>

<p>It is fairly routine for a referee to get dropped down a division for a game or two after a high profile mistake then come back into the fold once the heat dies down.</p>
<p>With just three full-time VAR officials Muir’s position is more problematic, he is already on the Ibrox banned list following the League Cup Final.</p>
<p>Nick Walsh will referee Sunday’s Scottish Cup tie against Hibs with Kevin Clancy on VAR.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Collum will announce the officials for the March 16 Glasgow Derby, the talent pool has never been shallower but that is entirely down to the SFA and their restrictive recruitment procedures.</p>
<p>When a world wide search for a new Head of Refereeing results in Collum being appointed there are clearly problems in the system- similar to Collum’s decision to create a full-time VAR gig for his mate Muir.</p>
