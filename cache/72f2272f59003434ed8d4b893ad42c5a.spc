<p>The fun loving Sky Sports pundit fears that will be when Celtic will again be crowned as SPFL Premiership champions.</p>
<p>Winning their next three matches will ensure a title party, win their next two and Barry Ferguson’s side will have to win at Dundee and at home to Hibs to delay the inevitable.</p>
<p>To the outside, sane world it will be just another title for Celtic but for folk like Boyd this one carries extra significance/misery.</p>
<p>Since 2012 the lies got bigger. Already this season The World’s Most Successful Club myth has been dismantled, less than six months after that blow the number 55 will be getting used much less frequently.</p>
<p>From their arrival in the SPFL Premiership for the 2015/16 season the Tribute Act were banging on about 55, a number of no significance anywhere in the sporting world.</p>
<p>50  is a landmark, 60 less so, 10 is notable but 55? No one cared or cares but if that lot want to make a song and dance over 55, if they want to trash Glasgow city centre, if they want to vandalise statues over that number then it is only right to throw it back in their faces with interest. Boyd’s face in particular.</p>
<p>Back in 2016 he was still double dunting, lumbering around the pitch trying to score his second career goal against Celtic while climbing the ladder at Sky Sports.</p>
<p>Explaining a 5-1 defeat at Celtic he clutched at the comfort blanket that if Barrie Mackay had scored it would have been very different.</p>
<p>Celtic fans laughed at Boyd, they’ve been laughing ever since with the exception of the Phantom Season when strange things went on with testing, when bears weren’t allowed in to Ibrox to hurl abuse at Captain Disappointed and the Serial Losers.</p>
<p>That season was the highlight of Boyd’s broadcasting career, the four years since have been one long, never ending nightmare of Celtic successes, there is a better than even money chance that this season will finish up with the hoops celebrating a sixth treble in nine seasons.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>30 minutes 20 seconds</strong></p>
<p><strong>Boyd:</strong> If they both keep winning (Celtic winning Sunday’s Derby) it will be St Johnstone, I’ve already</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Duncan:</strong> Are you taking that weekend off?</p>
<p><strong>Boyd:</strong> I’ve already put in for that weekend off. Yeah, 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> of April, do you think that I want to listen to you (turning to Sutton), you might need that cardboard cut out again! Yes, 6<sup>th</sup> of April I’m off, I’m off, I’ve already sorted it, I’m off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boyd should be in place at Celtic Park on Sunday, probably alongside any two from James McFadden, Stan Petrov and Neil Lennon who all know the buttons to press with their colleague.</p>
<p>After a Derby victory Boyd’s post match meltdown is always a highlight for Celtic fans, no matter how jovial he is in the build up losing at Celtic Park surrounded by gloating Celtic supporters and employees is just too much.</p>
<p>His voice gets higher and higher, the other pundits just need to drop in a comment or two and off he goes into classic Boyd mode demanding  a complete turnover of everything at Ibrox, except his wee Monster Munch buddie, Barry.</p>
<p>Sunday’s Derby match is just a warm-up event for Sky Sports but if Celtic win the pain will continue for Boyd, it’ll be 13 days later before they return to action away to Dundee where Billy Dodds can expect a hot reception having voted against a CVA trying to force another of his former clubs into liquidation.</p>
<p>On Monday Boyd will be required by Sky Sports and The Sun for a video interview from his padded cell, the gags are unlikely to be flowing as that dreaded number of 55 comes into sight for Scotland’s Most Successful Club.</p>
<p>Boyd expects Sunday&#8217;s Derby to finish as a draw.</p>

<p>Nico Raskin, Ianis Hagi and the usual suspects were all out in force after the January fixture claiming that there wasn’t much between the two clubs despite the evidence of the SPFL Premiership table.</p>
<p>Celtic left Ibrox in January with their lead trimmed to 11 points, at kick-off time on Sunday they have a 16 point lead, goal difference advantage of 37 and a new manager to face, the third since Brendan Rodgers took over from Ange Postecoglou less than two years ago.</p>
<p>Sutton took to the old Glasgow Derby in an instant, scoring three minutes into his debut as a 6-2 home win turned the tide Celtic’s way, almost a quarter of a century on that situation has been reinforced multiple times over the club formed by Charles Green in 2012.</p>
<p>For almost a decade Sutton has observed a familiar pattern from the side-lines, noise from Ibrox matched by delivery, results and dominance from Celtic.</p>
<p>Joey Barton discovered that it wasn’t a wise move to noise up Brendan Rodgers and Scott Brown, following a six goal thriller his coffee machine was soon unplugged and returning to the backwater of Burnley.</p>
<p>Urged on by their media messengers trash talking is a constant from the 2012 Tribute Act with James Tavernier an expert at claiming how different things will be this time next year.</p>
<p>Sutton has heard it all from Kris Boyd, Grame Souness and a cast of thousands. The script rarely alters with the former Celtic striker sensing that his old club are ready to deliver a very significant message on Sunday.</p>
<p>Addressing the motivation for a squad of players 16 points clear with nine matches left to play Sutton told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/rangers-great-big-talk-every-34857017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Record</a>:</p>
<p><em><strong>It shouldn’t be hard to get up for this one no matter what. If I was in that dressing room I’d see this as a chance to bury Rangers and get the title in the bag as soon as possible.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>They will also be desperate to right a few wrongs from Ibrox at Christmas. That was Celtic’s poorest performance of the season and it just seemed to come completely out of the blue.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Back then Rangers were toiling and people were wondering how many they’d lose by. Instead, it was Philippe Clement’s last stand as his team ran riot. Fair play, they were terrific on the day and Celtic were way off it.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>You can forgive Celtic for that as those off days have been few and far between. Yet that is the kind of result and performance that sticks in the throat of Brendan Rodgers. You could see it at the weekend with his stuff about Rangers stealing Celtic’s game in Govan.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>He is rightly proud of his incredible derby record – and he’d love to put Rangers in their place again. This is the chance to make a statement, to show who is boss in Glasgow.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rangers are great at the big talk. They are always coming or back, or whatever. Celtic are the ones in pole position in the league and they will be out to show why.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>This reminds me a bit of the final derby of the 2003/04 season. We’d ran away with the league and there was seemingly nothing much to play in the last encounter at Celtic Park.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We’d beaten Rangers in all three previous league games and in the Scottish Cup and the title race was over. We treated it like a must win though. It was nice to seal it in style with a finish most people will agree was world class.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The long ball, the flick on to Henrik Larsson, taking the return, shrugging off Frank de Boer and then chipping Stefan Klos from 30 yards. To be honest, I think it was more me knowing my capabilities end not fancying attempting to dribble the ball in.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>It was my son Ollie’s birthday as well and it’s still known as his Green and White Wash birthday.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>No one can say that game was mea</strong><strong>ningless – even if the points at stake didn’t change much. These games are never dull regardless and it will be interesting to see how both sides approach it.</strong></em></p>
<p>Sutton stamped his name all over the Derby fixture despite being up against incentivised opponents lured to Ibrox by Dave Murray’s disguised remuneration scams.</p>
<p>For two and a half months Rodgers has had the Ibrox defeat hanging over him, Clement failed to last the distance but the opposition shirt is the same with Barry Ferguson’s side set to face the backlash for that bizarre day in January.</p>

<p>Almost four weeks later there has been little evidence to support the Records eye-catching headline. Instead, we have had conjecture and occasional frenzied speculation, apparently fuelled by leaks from non-attributable sources.</p>
<p>The only on-the-record (no pun intended) comment has come from Dave King and that seemed intended to manage expectations in a downward direction.</p>
<p>Cutting through the waffle it now appears that the would-be bid comes not from the San Francisco 49ers but from individuals with some sort of connection to them. The name of Leeds United is frequently mentioned but no one has quite been able to pin down the role of the Yorkshire club and what its relationship might be with its potential stable mate.</p>
<p>None of this has deterred the frenzied speculation amongst the denizens of Ibrox. Particular concerns have been around which world class manager will be chosen to lead the newly minted club, the size of the supposed “war chest” for the next transfer window and even the prospects for an Everton-style new stadium. Images of the new look 70,000 seater Ibrox Stadium have been all over social media with Apple the natural sponsor since they are short on publicity according to several Ibrox insiders.</p>
<p>As in 2011, when a Motherwell-born billionaire was cheered to the echo as he walked the length of Edmiston Drive, there appears to be an extreme lack of risk awareness as to potential downsides. For supporters who have historically prized the idea of owners who “get it” there’s a curious lack of concern about the precise identity of the supposed new owner or owners. And, more importantly, what their intentions might be for Scotland’s newest senior football club.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-17129 size-medium" src="https://celtic365.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Jackson-McDermott-300x191.png" alt="Jackson, Daily Record, Ibrox" width="300" height="191" /></p>
<p>And there is a conundrum at the heart of this story. What is the attraction of a business which has never made a profit for a worldwide sports group? Or anyone else for that matter? This is a matter that would undoubtedly have engaged the attention of any intelligent well-motivated sports or financial journalist or broadcaster. So, naturally in Scotland in 2025, no one in the media has paid it any attention whatsoever.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which a loss-making business can be of value to a potential bidder.</p>
<p>Bizarre as it may seem losses themselves can be valuable. The latest set of accounts from <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/39646iezddpk/37KyRFiANn2FDpsmhGzdVI/a63f0e1d2efdda456f299ad6225195e6/Rangers_Reports_and_Accounts_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rangers International Football Club</a> contains this nugget of information on Page 52:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><i>At the Balance Sheet date, the Group has unrecognised tax losses of £108.4 million creating an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £27.1 million (2023 &#8211; £95.8 million creating an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £23.9 million).</i></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Put simply this means that anyone who <strong><em><b><i>could</i></b></em></strong> run RIFC profitably could generate a surplus of £108.4m over the next few years without having to pay any tax. Or, to put it more starkly, Celtic will pay £27.1m on its next £108.4m profit. RIFC will pay no taxes whatsoever. <strong><u><b>(Editor’s Note: so what’s new?).</b></u></strong></p>
<p>And, where there is more than one company in a group, a tax loss in one company can be offset against taxable profits in other group companies. That is the principal attraction of football clubs for many conglomerates and was almost certainly a major factor in Lawrence Marlborough and then David Murray taking over the Ibrox franchise in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Despite the blanket coverage in the Record almost nothing is known of the intentions of the prospective bidders for Rangers. Douglas Park, a successful Lanarkshire based businessman hasn&#8217;t even been contacted for his thoughts on the hysteria sweeping through the Record Sports Desk and their colleagues across the river at BBC Scotland.</p>
<p>So, it is pointless to speculate on what might happen. But it is possible to figure out a theoretical business model which might make a loss-making football club seem like a prime attraction for a bidder or perhaps even a predator.</p>

<p>The replies piled in on Blow The Whistle, a very professional looking Twitter account.</p>
<p>It came just a few days after Willie Collum admitted that Alan Muir had no evidence to disallow a ‘goal’ from Daizen Maeda against Hibs on February 22. Had the laws of the game been applied correctly the scoreline would have been 2-2 in the 83<sup>rd</sup> minute. Celtic have only lost two matches this season.</p>
<p>Blow The Whistle earned plenty of traction with a detailed breakdown of how many fouls it takes for SPFL Premiership clubs to have a player booked, the results were stark, and sadly predictable as far as Celtic fans are concerned.</p>
<p>Despite dominating virtually every domestic match an incredible number of free kicks are awarded against Celtic.</p>
<p>Typically with 65% or more possession in a match Celtic will have more than half of the free kicks awarded against them.</p>
<p>It is a pattern repeated regardless of who is the referee.</p>
<p>In a bid to break up play and earn a breather opposing players fall to the ground whenever a Celtic player closes them down, most of the time the referee will oblige with a free kick.</p>
<p>That halts any momentum, allows opponents to regroup and breaks up the flow of the game, the statistics are overwhelming.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have access to all the stats but I&#8217;d guess that the majority of fouls awarded against Celtic are against the forwards, especially the wingers as Nicolas Kuhn and Maeda track back, Celtic&#8217;s defenders are rarely tested.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>With Ange Postecoglou taking charge of Celtic in the summer of 2021 there was a big change in how the hoops played the game.</p>
<p>The new look side went to Aberdeen at the start of October looking for their first away win, they were up against a very formidable opponent in Bobby Madden who refereed the opening match of the season when Andy Halliday raked his studs down Callum McGregor’s calf without any card being shown. Halliday and Madden are top lads and podcast buddies.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/aberdeen-vs-celtic/stats/445320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky Sports</a> who covered the match Celtic had 61.4 possession but managed to commit 27 fouls during Aberdeen’s 38.6% of time on the ball.</p>
<p>Assuming a generous 60 minutes of the ball actually being in play fouls were awarded against Celtic basically every second minute. Jota was one of the worst offenders! Almost every time he approached Calvin Ramsey the Dons defender hit the deck, Madden obliged every time.</p>
<p>Aberdeen committed just 10 fouls. A foul every six minutes.</p>
<p>It is astonishing that a team with almost twice the amount of possession was fouling three times as frequently but as we’ve learned over recent seasons every effort is made by opponents and match officials to slow Celtic down. There are plenty of officials like Madden around.</p>
<p>In most home matches Celtic have 70-80% possession, almost as predictable the foul stats are much more even.</p>
<p>Beating <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cq8k91vx3j2t#MatchStats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dundee United</a> 3-0 last month the hoops had 76.1% possession but committed seven fouls compared to nine from the visitors.</p>
<p>Beating <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/czje9g4prv2t#MatchStats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aberdeen</a> 5-1 on February 25 Celtic had 69.2% possession but the foul count was eight against 13.</p>
<p>Referees are very, very willing to award free-kicks against Celtic but they don’t have the evidence to be handing out yellow cards.</p>
<p>Anyone looking for patterns in refereeing issues ought to start by looking at penalties conceded with one club managing runs of 69 and 73 SPFL Premiership matches without having a penalty awarded against them.</p>
<p>During his 10 months as manager, with Connor Goldson in the team Micky Beale didn’t have a single SPFL Premiership penalty awarded against his side.</p>

<p>Many fans would use different language to describe the performance of the man from the Crown Bar in Bellshill. Ever since Albion Rovers were denied a Scottish Cup victory at Ibrox in March 2014 the emerging referee from Lanarkshire has been ‘one for the watching’.</p>
<p>After the defeat at Tynecastle Rodgers spoke in measured tones, described the incidents and repeated the incompetence accusation in his post-match interviews with Sky Sports, BBC Scotland and the all in media conference.</p>
<p>Those comments earned Rodgers a one match touchline ban, he appealed against it unsuccessfully but refused to back down, there was no apology given to Beaton who had instructed Dozy Don Robertson to review a booking for Yang Hyun-jun that was upgraded to a red card then prompted a Hearts penalty for handball against Tomoki Iwata that even Steven Naismith couldn’t justify.</p>
<p>That match was the only domestic fixture in 2024 that Celtic lost.</p>
<p>Rodgers watched Celtic defeat Livingston from the stand at the Toni Macaroni Arena, he returned to work for the April 8 Derby match at Ibrox with Beaton refereeing the game as the SFA exacted revenge on the Irishman.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole saga Celtic said nothing, Mikey Nicholson hid in his office studying spreadsheets while working out what players he could sell off in the summer.</p>
<p>Since Rodgers made the incompetent claim about Beaton there has been seven Glasgow Derbies, on Sunday the man from the Crown Bar will be back on VAR duty- the fifth time in those seven fixtures that he has either been the match referee or VAR.</p>
<p>That is 71.4% of those matches. He was given time off for the final SPFL Premiership fixture of last season then for the most recent match at Ibrox after he had refereed the fixture in the first two clashes of the season.</p>
<p>You don’t need to dig too far for a pattern of decision making, it is similar to that of Alan Muir.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Rodgers' explosive press conference in FULL as he reckons Hearts defeat was 'decided' by officials" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RS4kG_wgB8g" width="824" height="487" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>I also think as well that VAR is not the problem here, that’s clear. It’s competence. And I think the first one is a great example of the game being refereed outside of the pitch. This is the thing everyone is talking about, that the officials do their job and if it’s something that’s clear and obvious maybe step in. The referee made the decision and someone outside made another decision to say it was a sending off. So that’s the game being refereed outside of the field and in big games that costs you.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I’m not one who comes crying about referees, be it here or the EPL, because I understand there will be mistakes made. But that today was awful officiating in what was a big game for us.</strong></em></p>
<p>Asked if it was the worst officiating that he had experienced in Scotland (which includes Beaton’s Alfredo Morelos masterclass at Ibrox in December 2018) the Celtic boss didn’t hesitate with his answer:</p>
<p><em><strong>I think so. In my time up here I’m not one to have a go at refs because I understand it’s a very very difficult position they are in. I try to respect decisions and give the benefit of the doubt.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>But I think when I see that level of incompetence is the only word I can use, then that makes me worry for the game. In such a tight title race, which it is and it’s fantastic and great to be involved in, that can make the difference. And that today made the difference for us.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>APRIL 8, 3-3 at Ibrox</strong></p>
<p>Beaton ignores a penalty box tag-team attack on Kyogo Furuhashi from Connor Goldson and Jack Butland that leaves the Celtic defender in a heap on the six yard line.</p>
<p>He misses a clear handball by Connor Goldson, VAR Nick Walsh relectantly get involves with Matt O’Riley scoring from the penalty spot.</p>
<p>After allowing 45 minutes of playacting from Fabio Silva go unpunished Beaton books the on loan Wolves forward for a dive. Walsh suggests a VAR review and suddenly it is Tavpen O’Clock.</p>
<p>Iwata is wiped out a few minutes later, play continues until Dessers finds the net, fortunately Walsh prompts Beaton into a review and the ‘goal’ is disallowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MAY 25, 1-0 Celtic in the Scottish Cup Final.</strong> Beaton on VAR duty.</p>
<p>Two clear Celtic penalty claims are ignored in the first half by referee Walsh, VAR checks are completed in 15 seconds.</p>
<p>In the first incident Ben Davies raises his hand to control the ball, in the second Davies pushes Leon Balogun into Kyogo as he prepares to shoot.</p>
<p>The VAR official that spotted Iwata’s handball at Tynecastle saw nothing wrong with either decision</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1 September, 3-0 at Celtic Park</strong></p>
<p>Celtic utterly dominate Phil Clement’s side, Andrew Dallas had the squiggly lines out to disallow a Kyogo ‘goal’ with the match scoreless but the hoops went in at the break leading 2-0, finishing the match 3-0 victors leaving the Belgian Beale scrambling around for comforting stats. No major controversies from Beaton other than breaking up Celtic’s play at every opportunity, full use of the Disadvantage Rule</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>15 December 3-3, League Cup Final</strong></p>
<p>Willie Collum showed his trust in Beaton by giving him successive Glasgow Derby appointments, showing the clear weakness of the newly installed Head of Refereeing.</p>
<p>Midway through the first half Jefte rankes his studs down the calf of Nicolas Kuhn but avoids a booking.</p>
<p>Leon Balogun was given licence to boot anything in green and white with Reo Hatate a particular target. After another attack on Cameron Carter-Vickers while on a yellow card the veteran defender was substituted in the 67<sup>th</sup> minute.</p>
<p>During extra-time Callum McGregor sent a quickly taken free kick through for Maeda to run onto with Clement’s defenders sleeping, fortunately Beaton blew his whistle and insisted on the free kick being retaken from virtually the same spot.</p>

<p>Thankfully for the Head of Refereeing at the SFA Kasper Schmeichel saved him from another scandal, this time involving the judgement of Nick Walsh.</p>
<p>On Friday the SFA finally released the evidence that Alan Muir overstepped the mark to wrongly disallow a ‘goal’ from Daizen Maeda away to Hibs. It wasn’t a factual overturn, it was the wish of the VAR official to deny Celtic a goal.</p>
<p>The long held suspicions of the Celtic support were confirmed, Muir has been left out of the last three rounds of fixtures.</p>
<p>During the four minutes of coverage on the VAR Review no explanation was offered for Muir’s behaviour, no consequences were discussed with nine rounds of SPFL Premiership fixtures to be covered with Muir one of three full-time officials on the SFA pay-roll.</p>
<p>This weekend Collum had four Scottish Cup ties over four days to monitor, all of the matches are going out live on television with Nick Walsh trusted with the top tie, Celtic v Hibs on Premier Sports on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Last season the Bearsden based school-teacher was regarded as Scotland’s top referee, taking charge of two of the five Glasgow Derbies including the Scottish Cup Final.</p>
<p>Eighteen minutes into yesterday’s match Walsh was almost facing his Alan Muir moment.</p>
<p>There seemed to be nothing brewing when Cameron Carter-Vickers cleared the ball out of play towards the Celtic dug-out. What happened next caught Walsh sleeping, he switched off, almost causing a goal that would have dominated the headlines.</p>
<p>Josh Campbell continued his run, saw a pitchside ball and quickly threw it into play more than 15 yards away from where the ball went out.</p>
<p>As the still image below shows Walsh had a perfect view of what was going on, allowed play to continue with Kieron Bowie racing in to fire a shot on goal that Schmeichel blocked at the expense of a corner.</p>
<p>The Celtic keeper let the referee know his feelings, the fans shouted their concern while Walsh breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There is no mechanism through VAR to intervene if Bowie’s shot had gone into the net, a throw-in isn’t for VAR officials to judge on with the decision of the on-field official to stand.</p>
<p>By switching off for a few seconds Walsh was very nearly compromised, if Schmeichel hadn’t saved there would have been over 50,000 angry fans on the referees case just days after Muir’s actions had been exposed.</p>
<p>In a nightmare scenario for Collum the incident could have been next Sunday with Cyriel Dessers running through on goal to put the visitors 1-0 up. Perhaps that is going too far.</p>
<p>Walsh, John Beaton, Don Robertson and Steve McLean are the only current referees that have taken charge of the Glasgow Derby, McLean’s two appointments coming seven years apart.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning the SFA will announce the officials for next Sunday’s Derby clash, with the destination of the title virtually decided Collum would like to add a new name to the rota available for that match.</p>
<p>Matthew MacDermid was probably being earmarked for the match but was highlighted on the latest VAR Review show as having made two on pitch mistakes.</p>
<p>That leaves the way clear for David Dickinson to referee the match, on Facebook it is quite clear that his family all support that Ibrox Tribute Act.</p>
<p>Collum has a multitude of issues to deal with due to the shallow pool of talent available to him, on Sunday Schmeichel saved him from one more headache, bailing out the incompetence of Walsh.</p>

<p>For decades the paranoid card has been thrown at hoops supporters, with the release of the audio from Ester Road it is clear that fans weren’t paranoid enough.</p>
<p>The emotion and determination of Muir to disallow the ‘goal’ takes it way beyond Honest Mistake territory.</p>
<p>Only a complete idiot would believe that this is the first time that Muir has gone out of his way to defy the Laws of the Game in matches involving Celtic.</p>
<p>He first came to prominence at the 2015 Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness Caley Thistle, a decade later he is still going strong, now with the security of a full-time SFA salary.</p>
<p>As the newly appointed Head of Refereeing at the SFA one of Willie Collum’s first tasks was giving Muir a full-time VAR job, as a refereeing colleague for more than a decade Collum knows exactly what his mate Muir is.</p>
<p>Collum has been playing the media game all season, they praise him as a good honest guy but he is as much in the spotlight now as Muir.</p>
<p>Does he continue with a VAR official hell bent on giving the decision that he wants despite the warnings of his lesser qualified assistant (Ross McLeod) that the evidence isn’t there.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxVKVzcBqGg&amp;t=289s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VAR Review</a> Collum says:</p>
<p><em><strong>Let&#8217;s think what the starting point is? The starting point is the on-field decision. The on-field decision is the assistant referee keeps the flag down and a goal is scored.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>So, as far as the assistant referee is concerned, the ball has not gone out of play.  The VAR and AVAR of course go into a check, which they are expected to do so. They need to assess with the cameras and the footage available if the ball is out of play.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>You hear the VAR at one point say that it looks like it&#8217;s gone out of play from a particular angle, and then AVAR correctly says &#8216;I don&#8217;t think you can be conclusive there&#8217;.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Then an angle appears from the main camera and you hear a reaction, the VAR and AVAR both think at that point that&#8217;s evidence to say the ball is out of play.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>However, what I want to be very clear about, and we coach the VAR&#8217;s and AVAR&#8217;s to be certain about this, you need 100 per cent conclusive evidence to disallow the goal here and prove that the ball is over the goal line.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>And in this case, that is not possible. It&#8217;s not possible to prove categorically that the ball has crossed the goal line fully, because we know from previous examples at World Cup&#8217;s that a ball can look out from certain angles, but then when you look at the camera above &#8211; because in World Cup competitions there&#8217;s the spider cam and a clear camera on the goal line. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>A slight part, even a millimetre of the ball can be overhanging that goal line, and that&#8217;s enough to say that the ball is in play. It&#8217;s impossible to prove otherwise.</strong></em></p>
<p>Well Willie, you’ve left Muir out of two rounds of SPFL Premiership fixtures and the Scottish Cup quarter-finals, will you continue that or slip him back in hoping that none of the Internet Bampots will notice?</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There is one other significant party involved in this issue- the board of Celtic, especially their CEO and Chairman.</p>
<p>Since July 2012 Celtic have barely raised a murmur of complaint against the SFA.</p>
<p>When on-line anger reaches a peak Peter Lawwell or Michael Nicholson will reach out for the Surprised and Disappointed Statement Template, shift the variables, click on publish then go to the back of the bus to stare at their brogues.</p>
<p>Once a year the board are questioned about their meek acceptance of anything thrown out by their friends at the SFA at the club AGM.</p>
<p>2021 Chairman Bankier claims that referees are a deep source of concern when questioned on Nick Walsh and Bobby Madden</p>
<p>2023 CEO Nicholson gives his penalty to Rangers gag when questioned on a John Beaton issue</p>
<p>2024 Nicholson compliments the SFA for the VAR Review bringing transparency to refereeing issues. He had been asked if he backed Brendan Rodgers calling Beaton incompetent after the match at Tynecastle in March 2024, the Celtic CEO refused to back the club manager.</p>
<p>The release of audio from Easter Road is certainly a game changer, it is no longer honest mistakes, this is fresh grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Ross Macleod</strong> (Assistant VAR): Potential ball out of play</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> Ball out of play</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> No, it is inconclusive</p>
<p><strong>Steven McLean:</strong> They will check it OK?</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> OK, checking onfield decision of goal</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> I don’t think that you can conclusively say that that’s out</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Any other angles</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> That’s not conclusive either</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> There!</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> Yeah, happy with that</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> We’re going to give a factual review here, overturn</p>
<p><strong>Muir:</strong> And I want you to award a goal kick</p>
<p>Now that Muir has been outed the spotlight is on Collum and Nicholson. On past experiences both will attempt to sit it out, next weekend the Celtic CEO welcomes more than 2,000 Ibrox fans to the Glasgow Derby, complete with their songs of poison and hate that fly in the face of the Unacceptable Conduct regulations.</p>
<p>In three and a half years as CEO Nicholson hasn&#8217;t once raised his voice. On Wednesday and Thursday statements were issued criticising supporter behaviour, Celtic do love an easy target which is why Collum knows that he can count on the silent backing of Lawwell&#8217;s former sidekick that now draws a salary as CEO.</p>

<p>The incident at Easter Road is bad enough but earlier this season he ‘missed’ a push on Maeda by Stephen O’Donnell that should have resulted in a penalty for Celtic. Muir did notice that the forward had put the ball in the net with his arm but failed to highlight the push.</p>
<p>With just three full-time VAR officials they are in demand for the high profile matches, Muir has been on duty at 6 of Celtic’s 29 SPFL matches, just over 20%.</p>
<p>The extent of the error at Easter Road is is one thing but hearing the audio is even more damning, he sounds like an opposition fan desperately trying to find something, anything to disallow the goal.</p>
<p>Finally he found the ‘evidence’ to back up his wish, from a camera on the 18 yard line looking through Alistair Johnston he found the conclusive angle that the ball was out.</p>
<p>Whether the ball was in or out is no longer an issue, the problem for Muir is that there absolutely wasn’t factual evidence that the ball had gone out of play.</p>
<p>On today’s VAR Review Collum admitted:</p>
<p><em><strong>Let&#8217;s think what the starting point is? The starting point is the on-field decision. The on-field decision is the assistant referee keeps the flag down and a goal is scored. So, as far as the assistant referee is concerned, the ball has not gone out of play. The VAR and AVAR of course go into a check, which they are expected to do so. They need to assess with the cameras and the footage available if the ball is out of play.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>You hear the VAR at one point say that it looks like it&#8217;s gone out of play from a particular angle, and then AVAR correctly says &#8216;I don&#8217;t think you can be conclusive there’. Then an angle appears from the main camera and you hear a reaction, the VAR and AVAR both think at that point that&#8217;s evidence to say the ball is out of play.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Now, what I want to be very clear about, and we coach the VAR&#8217;s and AVAR&#8217;s to be certain about this, you need 100 per cent conclusive evidence to disallow the goal here and prove that the ball is over the goal line. And in this case, that is not possible. It&#8217;s not possible.</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course Muir has plenty of previous for baffling decisions regarding Celtic, he has been watched closely since his Additional Assistant role in the 2015 Scottish Cup semi final defeat from Inverness Caley Thistle. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=josh+meekings+handball&amp;oq=josh+meeking&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgDEAAYgAQyCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyBwgBEC4YgAQyBggCEEUYOTIHCAMQABiABDIICAQQABgWGB4yCAgFEAAYFhgeMggIBhAAGBYYHjINCAcQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAgQABiGAxiABBiKBdIBCDkzNjlqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> &#8216;Josh Meeking handball&#8217; if you need a reminder</p>

<p>Discussing the Maeda penalty incident at Motherwell Collum had no defence for Muir’s decision to notice handball from the Celtic forward but not the push on him by Stephen O’Donnell.</p>
<p><em><strong>For us, this is not normal contact. We think the Celtic attacker is more ahead of the Motherwell defender. We think that is an arm movement by the Motherwell defender and also then causes a collision in the ground as well by the legs as well as the arm.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We think this should be a penalty kick. We want the referee to be brought to on-field review to award a penalty kick here.</strong></em></p>

<p>It is fairly routine for a referee to get dropped down a division for a game or two after a high profile mistake then come back into the fold once the heat dies down.</p>
<p>With just three full-time VAR officials Muir’s position is more problematic, he is already on the Ibrox banned list following the League Cup Final.</p>
<p>Nick Walsh will referee Sunday’s Scottish Cup tie against Hibs with Kevin Clancy on VAR.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Collum will announce the officials for the March 16 Glasgow Derby, the talent pool has never been shallower but that is entirely down to the SFA and their restrictive recruitment procedures.</p>
<p>When a world wide search for a new Head of Refereeing results in Collum being appointed there are clearly problems in the system- similar to Collum’s decision to create a full-time VAR gig for his mate Muir.</p>

<p>Alan Muir has been left out of VAR appointments for three successive rounds of fixtures.</p>
<p>While they will never be able to take the title of Statement FC from their city rivals Celtic have issued statements on successive days about supporter behaviour.</p>
<p>It is hard to pick fault with the first one, there are plenty of backers for Pyro but while it is illegal to use without authorisation the club is always going to be at the mercy of the SFA, SPFL and Police Scotland over the use of Pyro inside football stadiums.</p>
<p>The second statement, issued on Thursday is almost a non-statement, more notable for what it avoids with no ownership claimed.</p>
<p>Most people will assume that the banners causing upset were viewed at the Bayern Munich matches and aimed at Israel. There was also a banner paying tribute to Bik McFarlane before the SPFL match against Aberdeen, McFarlane had similar political views to many of Celtic&#8217;s founders.</p>
<p>But, not only is the source of the upset not announced, the club is hiding behind ‘ the concerns communicated by our own supporters’ rather than being proactive with their own views.</p>
<p>The language used is about as non-committal as it is possible to find, leaving their media partners to apply whatever context they wish.</p>
<p>Typically no-one at the club is quoted, the CEO and Chairman haven’t put their name to it which is typical of their levels of leadership.</p>
<p>If Michael Nicholson or Peter Lawwell are so concerned by the banners why won’t they put their thoughts onto the statement?</p>
<p>Just before 5.30pm on Thursday, shortly before another football match kicked off the <a href="https://www.celticfc.com/news/2025/march/06/club-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celtic website</a> carried the following statement:</p>
<p><em><strong>Celtic Football Club shares the concerns communicated by our own supporters regarding the use of banners at recent matches.  </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Celtic is an inclusive football club open to all, with no political agenda, as is clear from the Club’s Social Charter and Social Mission Statement, and no group of supporters, or any other organisation, speaks on behalf of Celtic.   </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Everyone associated with Celtic recognises the important part that Celtic supporters play in inspiring the team and contributing to the Celtic spirit. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fan displays should support the team, or otherwise celebrate Celtic, and be consistent with the terms of the Celtic Social Charter, Social Mission Statement and other terms that apply to all supporters’ enjoyment of Celtic.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>That is why the Club developed a protocol regarding the use of banners and organised displays at Celtic Park, or any other stadia where Celtic plays, requiring the pre-approval of fan displays.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Although there have been many occasions on which the Club’s protocol has been followed with great success and support for the team and for Celtic, unfortunately, there have been instances in the past weeks where the protocol has not been followed, with unauthorised banners, which had not been submitted for pre-approval in line with the protocol, displayed at Celtic Park.  </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Club is reviewing these events and relevant processes.  </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We have enjoyed a good season so far, and we want to achieve, together with our supporters, as much as we possibly can as we approach the latter part of the season. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank our fans for their continuing support and collective understanding that Club protocols, and safety and competition regulations, must be adhered to in order to protect the Club and our fans, so that all Celtic supporters feel able to attend Celtic Park and all matches involving Celtic.</strong></em></p>

<p>The statement hasn’t been carried on Celtic’s social media accounts which misses a great opportunity to spread their concerns.</p>
<p>On X/Twitter is is business as usual, there was an Instagram Q and A with Arne Engels when the statement was released, this morning there are ticket details for the pre-season friendly away to Cork City.</p>
<p>Celtic’s increased interest in the behaviour of customers inside their stadium has another aspect to it. On March 16 over 2,000 away fans will attend the Glasgow Derby, that fixture should test the club and their concerns about Unacceptable Behaviour.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Daily Record dives headlong into Ibrox fan media to taunt Celtic supporters</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17145 aligncenter" src="https://celtic365.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Daily-Record-San-Francisco-49ers-231x300.png" alt="Daily Record 49ers" width="231" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>The Daily Record is stepping up its race to merge with Ibrox fan media as they chase a digital audience to stay afloat.</strong></p>
<p>With print sales hovering at just over 40,000 a day the management at the Record has virtually given up on that market with the paper edition an afterthought from the previous days online content.</p>
<p>Savvy Celtic fans have steered well clear of the Glasgow based publisher for years, it is a guilty pleasure for many as they take in the spin from fakeovers through to super stadiums, hover pitches and a variety of other moonbeams.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is full on but this morning the more subtle approach is taken as they wrap up a number of fantasies aimed at grabbing a share of the online market.</p>
<p>The Seville Calculator is a favoured phrase among online bears as they mock the number of Celtic fans who travelled to the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.</p>
<p>The internet was still in its earliest days, most fans had to book up through traditional travel agents, finding a direct from from Scotland to Spain was almost impossible a week after the semi-final victory over Boavista.</p>
<p>From the last 16 victory over Stuttgart many fans booked up a weeks holiday in Spain for May, just in case. Buses left Benidorm, Alicante and other Costa hotspots for six hour journeys and more, others were happy to soak up the atmosphere in a friendly holiday resort.</p>
<p>In total 21,000 fans flew ‘directly’ from Scotland to the match, those flights went  to Seville, Faro and Malaga, the majority of fans had to make alternative arrangement with additional flights put on from Manchester and London to cope with the demand.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-17243 size-full" src="https://celtic365.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Daily-Record-Seville.png" alt="" width="1244" height="795" /></p>
<p>The Record reported:</p>
<p><em><strong>Alan Brazil admits he COULD see Jose Mourinho managing Rangers.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Fenerbahce boss was asked directly about managing Gers &#8211; or bitter rivals Celtic &#8211; by Record Sport in his pre-match press conference ahead of the Europa League last 16 first leg clash against Barry Ferguson&#8217;s men in Istanbul. The Special One said not right now, but in the future, why not? As he praised the passion of Scottish football, admitting it has the &#8220;fire&#8221; he looks for in a league.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>And while talkSport host Brazil jokingly told Mourinho to stay away from Ibrox, he did admit that with the fresh investment about to pour into Rangers from 49ers Enterprises as they close in on a deal to buy the club, that he wouldn&#8217;t completely dismiss Mourinho becoming the new gaffer in Govan at some stage. But only after giving Gabby Agbonlahor a brief history lesson on Celtic vs Mourinho&#8217;s Porto in the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.</strong></em></p>
<p>One sobering thought for the management of the Record is that there were twice as many Celtic fans in Seville compared to the number buying the Record today.</p>
<p>There is more chance of circulation of the Record soaring to 49,000 than of the San Francisco 49ers taking control of the 2012 Ibrox Tribute Act and bankrolling a spending splurge as the Record reported 15 days</p>
<p>Every newspaper produced a supplement or pull-out, they all jumped on board because they knew that there was huge demand and interest in the match.</p>
<p>BBC Scotland and STV sent out teams of reporters to base themselves in Seville with the tea-time news magazines full of content from supporters enjoying the 30 degrees plus temperatures in the most sophisticated of Spanish cities. The Record even sent out a &#8216;Battle Bus&#8217; to Seville, not all fans were pleased with that reminder from home.</p>
<p>The support that went to Seville in 2003 was real, awards followed from UEFA and FIFA, it was the biggest ever movement of Scottish fans outside of the UK.</p>
<p>No arrests were made, you’ll barely find a mention of Manchester 2008 on the pages of the ailing Glasgow tabloid.</p>

<p>With print sales hovering at just over 40,000 a day the management at the Record has virtually given up on that market with the paper edition an afterthought from the previous days online content.</p>
<p>Savvy Celtic fans have steered well clear of the Glasgow based publisher for years, it is a guilty pleasure for many as they take in the spin from fakeovers through to super stadiums, hover pitches and a variety of other moonbeams.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is full on but this morning the more subtle approach is taken as they wrap up a number of fantasies aimed at grabbing a share of the online market.</p>
<p>The Seville Calculator is a favoured phrase among online bears as they mock the number of Celtic fans who travelled to the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.</p>
<p>The internet was still in its earliest days, most fans had to book up through traditional travel agents, finding a direct from from Scotland to Spain was almost impossible a week after the semi-final victory over Boavista.</p>
<p>From the last 16 victory over Stuttgart many fans booked up a weeks holiday in Spain for May, just in case. Buses left Benidorm, Alicante and other Costa hotspots for six hour journeys and more, others were happy to soak up the atmosphere in a friendly holiday resort.</p>
<p>In total 21,000 fans flew ‘directly’ from Scotland to the match, those flights went  to Seville, Faro and Malaga, the majority of fans had to make alternative arrangement with additional flights put on from Manchester and London to cope with the demand.</p>

<p>The Record reported:</p>
<p><em><strong>Alan Brazil admits he COULD see Jose Mourinho managing Rangers.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Fenerbahce boss was asked directly about managing Gers &#8211; or bitter rivals Celtic &#8211; by Record Sport in his pre-match press conference ahead of the Europa League last 16 first leg clash against Barry Ferguson&#8217;s men in Istanbul. The Special One said not right now, but in the future, why not? As he praised the passion of Scottish football, admitting it has the &#8220;fire&#8221; he looks for in a league.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>And while talkSport host Brazil jokingly told Mourinho to stay away from Ibrox, he did admit that with the fresh investment about to pour into Rangers from 49ers Enterprises as they close in on a deal to buy the club, that he wouldn&#8217;t completely dismiss Mourinho becoming the new gaffer in Govan at some stage. But only after giving Gabby Agbonlahor a brief history lesson on Celtic vs Mourinho&#8217;s Porto in the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.</strong></em></p>
<p>One sobering thought for the management of the Record is that there were twice as many Celtic fans in Seville compared to the number buying the Record today.</p>
<p>There is more chance of circulation of the Record soaring to 49,000 than of the San Francisco 49ers taking control of the 2012 Ibrox Tribute Act and bankrolling a spending splurge as the Record reported 15 days</p>
<p>Every newspaper produced a supplement or pull-out, they all jumped on board because they knew that there was huge demand and interest in the match.</p>
<p>BBC Scotland and STV sent out teams of reporters to base themselves in Seville with the tea-time news magazines full of content from supporters enjoying the 30 degrees plus temperatures in the most sophisticated of Spanish cities. The Record even sent out a &#8216;Battle Bus&#8217; to Seville, not all fans were pleased with that reminder from home.</p>
<p>The support that went to Seville in 2003 was real, awards followed from UEFA and FIFA, it was the biggest ever movement of Scottish fans outside of the UK.</p>
<p>No arrests were made, you’ll barely find a mention of Manchester 2008 on the pages of the ailing Glasgow tabloid.</p>
