<p style="font-weight: 400;">They created a great atmosphere and even when they went 2-0 down they raised the noise levels supporting their players who before the game had gone 15 games unbeaten including a 2-1 win at Easter Road against Celtic in the League.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully it was not Sunshine on Leith but instead it was Sunshine in Paradise as the weather heated up, the sun was shining over Celtic Park as the Winter weather gave way to some welcome Spring sun. It was Celtic who were singing at the end of the game and it was Daizen Maeda who once again shone the brightest with another Man of Match performance</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He opened the scoring and second half sub Adam Idah added the second goal to finally wrap up the game. Celtic dominated the game and Hibs defended very well for long periods when they were under pressure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://celticfanzine.com/product-category/t-shirts/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59839" src="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1.png" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1.png 624w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1-300x300.png 300w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1-150x150.png 150w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1-100x100.png 100w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After the game it was a quick dash to the airport to catch the 7:30pm flight home which was packed with happy Celtic fans unlike this weekend when I travelled home for the St. Mirren game in the company of some very disgruntled rangers fans.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully they will be just as annoyed next weekend after they leave Celtic Park. Their domestic form is terrible lately although their Europa League form may give them and their new manager Barry Ferguson some confidence ahead of the visit to the East End of Glasgow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Celtic have only suffered a handful of defeats both domestically and in Europe this season. One of those defeats was at Ibrox when the Celtic players forgot to turn up. The Celtic fans are expecting a revenge performance as the team steam roll towards another League title and a Scottish Cup a semi-final v St. Johnstone at Hampden.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Confidence is high at Celtic Park and fans are dreaming of another treble under Brendan Rodgers. Nothing beats being inside Celtic Park at kick off on match days and tickets for this one are in high demand with the rangers fans back in for the first time since they spit out the dummy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I will not be in Celtic Park on Sunday instead I will be joining former Celtic player Didier Agathe on the roof top of O’ Shea’s bar in Bangkok to preview the game before watching with the members of Bangkok CSC and Celtis Fans who are joining us from around the globe for the Trip to Thai 3 Celtic Festival.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hibs travel from Edinburgh in confident mood. They are the inform team and have knocked up an impressive 15-game unbeaten record after getting beaten 3-0 by Celtic on their last visit to Paradise but took all 3 points when we visited Easter Road a few weeks back and they beat their city rivals Hearts last week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So we have a battle between the two best teams (at the moment in Scotland) . Celtic the defending champions and at home should be confident of a win after what could be a hard fought battle The enormity of Hibs&#8217; task on Sunday is highlighted by the fact they have never previously beaten Celtic away from home in the Scottish Cup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since that defeat to Hibs, Celtic were unlucky to be knocked out of the Champions League by German Giants, Bayern Munich and beat Aberdeen 5-1 and St Mirren 5-2. Celtic’s home record is an impressive one having not lost to a Scottish side since Hearts took all 3 points in December 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://celticfanzine.com/product-category/t-shirts/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59845" src="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLAS-CEL-TEE-624x624-1.png" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLAS-CEL-TEE-624x624-1.png 624w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLAS-CEL-TEE-624x624-1-300x300.png 300w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLAS-CEL-TEE-624x624-1-150x150.png 150w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLAS-CEL-TEE-624x624-1-100x100.png 100w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLAS-CEL-TEE-624x624-1-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Celtic players will be chomping at the bit to get revenge on Hibs after the controversial result in Edinburgh when we were robbed of at least a point by VAR and a poor referee. Inform Scottish player of the month Daizen Maeda thought he had equalised before it was ruled out and who would bet against him grabbing the headlines on Sunday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Maeda has already scored 3 goals against Hibs and Celtic have already knocked them out of the league cup back in August but Hibs were only finding their feet back then and are much improved since then.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Celtic have plenty of attacking options as do Hibs and it could be some shoot out for a place in the semi-final. The last time Hibs beat Celtic is the Scottish Cup was March 1986. Lets hope it is the Green and White of Glasgow and not Edinburgh who are celebrating come Sunday evening.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Cork Super Cup is a joint initiative between Cork GAA and sports marketing agency Druid Sport to bring another record-breaking mid-summer event to the stadium.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cork City v Celtic will only be the third ever soccer match to be staged at the historic grounds. The city has a number of Celtic Supporters Clubs and I am sure they will be looking forward to welcoming travelling Celtic fans to the city and the local pubs and hotels will benefit from having us in the city.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Celtic have played Cork City in friendlies on Leeside before, including a famous 2-0 victory for the home side during a visit in 1992, while a team of Celtic and Manchester United legends played a team of Ireland legends at the stadium in 2018, in memory of the late Liam Miller.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said: “We are delighted to be travelling to Cork to play in this fantastic match in the summertime. We will be visiting a great stadium in a fine city and we are sure the game will be a wonderful occasion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Celtic’s Irish connections are very important to the Club and we are sure there will be huge interest in the match. From my own perspective it will be great to be going home to Ireland but also from a footballing side we are really looking forward to the match against Cork City, which will be an important part of our preparations for next season.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cork City manager, Tim Clancy said: “We are lucky to have such an incredible fanbase at City, and know they will turn out in force to show Celtic what the Rebel Army is capable of.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have enjoyed incredible support since the start of the League of Ireland Premier Division season, and the opportunity to place a fantastic team in Celtic at an iconic setting is one that both the team and the fans can look forward to.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Football kick-off times have always been controversial when it comes to TV dictating for their schedule but from a selfish point of view, I love these 5:30pm kick off times. No travelling over the night before to be on time for the early supporters bus up the road for a midday kick off or no red eye flight in the morning which has you up out of bed when the night clubbers are still raving.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59826" src="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GD-POST-.png" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GD-POST-.png 1080w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GD-POST--300x300.png 300w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GD-POST--1024x1024.png 1024w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GD-POST--150x150.png 150w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GD-POST--768x768.png 768w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GD-POST--100x100.png 100w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GD-POST--624x624.png 624w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GD-POST--600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I took a noon bus from Drogheda to catch the 2:45pm flight to Glasgow from Dublin before a short bus journey into Paisley and a stroll to the ground arriving at 5pm in plenty of time to pick up my ticket and get in for kick off. I even got a chat with Average Joe Miller from Not the View ahead of kick off as former Celtic striker Mark Burchill passed by on his way in to watch the game.  I’m sure he got a mention or two during his time at Celtic in NTV.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With tickets so scarce there was only a small handful of Celtic fans on the flight and most of them were still without tickets. I spoke to them on the way home and they told me they just watched in a pub but enjoyed the day out.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoyment was a key factor of the day by the time we landed in Glasgow it was halftime in the rangers v Motherwell game and the score was 0-2 to the visitors. Ibrox must have been a quiet place at halftime. Full time for those who were left it was boo time after a 2-1 defeat and they handed Celtic the chance to go 16 points clear.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">   <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59838" src="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/st-mirren-away-.png" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/st-mirren-away-.png 1080w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/st-mirren-away--300x300.png 300w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/st-mirren-away--1024x1024.png 1024w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/st-mirren-away--150x150.png 150w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/st-mirren-away--768x768.png 768w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/st-mirren-away--100x100.png 100w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/st-mirren-away--624x624.png 624w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/st-mirren-away--600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere outside the ground was one of smiles and laughter with the news of the latest ranger’s meltdown with their dream team of ex rangers’ players in place to appease the fans after the sacking of Clement carrying on where the Belgian left over with a home defeat.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When Barry Ferguson’s name is getting chanted before the game kicked off by 2,300 Celtic fans it only adds fuel to the fire for the rangers’ fans. Many who were on my flight back home. I listened with interest to those around me who ranted about the rangers’ board who they are laying the blame at that’s for sure. They also spoke of the time they had to get out of bed for each home game, the money they spend and losing to the” The mighty Queens Park, the mighty St. Mirren and the mighty Motherwell” Their words not mine! A Hatrick of mighty defeats at Ibrox.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pity I did not get to record it for the Celtic Soul Podcast it would have made some great listening. Earlier today I got a chance to watch back highlights of both Celtic and the rangers’ games from yesterday and the post match interviews. While Barry is clearly not happy Brendan Rodgers was in much better form talking about it being one of his favourite games of the season and joking about how Yang’s girlfriend is in Glasgow, and he is hoping she stays after witnessing a super sub performance from the South Korean.</p>
<p><a href="https://celticfanzine.com/product-category/t-shirts/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59839" src="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1.png" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1.png 624w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1-300x300.png 300w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1-150x150.png 150w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1-100x100.png 100w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/GLASGOW-TEE-624x624-1-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In fairness to St. Mirren, they made a great game of it and missed some good chances in front of goal. Their fans celebrated both their equalising goals and will have been still buzzing from beating the rangers at Ibrox but today Brendan Rodgers strength in dept on the bench proved to be the game changer even if they had a good shout for a penalty the game finished 5-2 to the Celts.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Schlupp opened his Celtic goal account with a quality strike after his loan move from Crystal Palace before the home side equalised from a free kick on the edge of the box in front of the Celtic fans. Maeda was taken down in the box and Engel converted from the penalty spot before former Drogheda United player, Killian Philips equalised.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Brendan made 3 changes in the second half off came Idah, McGregor and Kuhn on went Jotta, Cowan (who hit the post with a great effort) and Yang. The Celtic fans may have been excited by the arrival Jota on to the pitch and we were singing his song, but it was super sub-Yang who stole the show with 3 goals (one was chalked off for being offside) and a brilliant assist for Maeda to convert.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">With 9 games to go Celtic are the Champions in waiting. Next on the list a Scottish Cup Quarter Final at Celtic Park v Hibs next Sunday. Johnny Kenny who came on late in yesterday’s game was on the flight last night with Killian Philips. I had a brief chat with them as we got off the plane and we shared a little joke.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The rangers’ fans are back in Celtic Park in a few weeks lets hope we can add more hurt to the meltdown mob from across the city but first we must despatch of Hibs to keep our treble dream alive.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">For once tickets were plentiful for an away game. The ticket allocation was healthy and our viewing from the top tier was impressive including the Munich Ultras camped behind the goals in the opposite end.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Police presence in the city all afternoon was low key but As Celtic fans began to gather to march to the underground the Police presence increased as did the noise of the Ultras drum. The singing became louder and fans marched through the streets to the underground with Police to the front and back stopping traffic for safe passage.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The train was packed for the short journey to the stadium and the banter was good as the songs and chants got louder as the train arrived at the stadium. The walk to the ground was marshalled by Police and safety officers and there were plenty of toilets for light relief.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Once at the turnstiles we were met with some familiar faces from the Celtic Park security team who pointed us in the right direction to enter. A quick search and we were inside in plenty of time to get a beer before entering to upper area to take our place among the faithful.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere was building and the Celtic players were finishing their warm up as  the noise levels increased when they came up the tunnel on the big screen and onto the field of play.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The game was tense at times and glances were regular to the big screens to check how many minutes were played. Celtic were not going out gunned on the night and had some good chances before Nicholas Kuhn sent us into wild celebrations and the Munich fans and their players got nervous which only added to the atmosphere in the away end.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the end a last minute controversial goal was the difference between both teams. Bayern through on a 3-2 aggregate score. There was no holding us in for an hour to let the home fans leave, all 75,000 of us left together and headed for the trains which were lined up waiting to take us back into the city for a night cap.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The home fans were quiet on the train back in the city. Maybe they were in shock that we had them on the ropes or maybe they are so used to winning they forgot what it is like to celebrate a European win. If we had won that game we would still be partying now.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">This seasons campaign in the Champions League has been one of the best I have witnessed in many years travelling around Europe with the Bhoys. This trip has been an amazing experience. 3 games in less than a week with many miles travelled, a few beers and plenty of laughs with like minded people. The Bhoys done us proud.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hibs next on Saturday at Easter Road is a chance to increase our points tally and also a dress rehearsal for the up coming Scottish Cup game at Celtic Park against the Edinburgh side.</p>

We arrived in Munich yesterday via a nights stop over in Riga and we are looking forward to the game tonight on another European adventure.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">On our first away adventure in Dortmund we were thought a hard lesson collectively the Celtic manager, his players and us the Celtic fans got a wake up call. Leaving the stadium in Germany that night no Celtic fan could be blamed for thinking that Brendan Rodgers had picked up for where he had left off during his first stint when coming up against top European teams away from Glasgow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We travelled back to Dusseldorf on the train that night in almost silence, shaking our heads and sipping a few beers to ease the pain of another embarrassing away day defeat in Europe. I was having flash backs to Paris and Barcelona. The head was shaking!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But to his credit Brendan Rodgers picked the team up and went again and in Bergamo the team delivered an impressive defensive performance against inform Europa League Champions Atalanta.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since then we have pushed on winning games we hoped we would draw and shared the spoils against teams we thought we could beat and with knock out stage achieved against Young Boys. We travelled to Birmingham with hope in our hearts to take on Aston Villa who showed on the night that they are a quality side and although we battled back to make it 2-2 we finally came unstuck to their quality. We can’t compete with these teams on financial terms but we seem to be learning how to compete with them on the pitch and that is down to the manager and his backroom team.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last  Wednesday night we witnessed a really good performance against a top European side in Bayern Munich and they followed it up on Saturday with a really good performance against Dundee United. Bayern Munich are a team that consistently performs on the big stage in Europe and domestically they have been scoring an average of over 3 goals a game in the German Bundesliga which is impressive.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We all thought we would enjoy our half time pie discussing a 0-0 scoreline but we got hit by a sucker punch by Bayern’s most impressive player Olise just on the stroke of the half time whistle. A body blow to everyone in Celtic Park and watching around the globe who follow the Celtic.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://celticfanzine.com/product-category/t-shirts/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59514" src="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/TEES-.png" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/TEES-.png 1414w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/TEES--212x300.png 212w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/TEES--724x1024.png 724w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/TEES--768x1086.png 768w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/TEES--1086x1536.png 1086w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/TEES--624x883.png 624w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/TEES--600x849.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1414px) 100vw, 1414px" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Then just as we got comfortable back in our seats boom they score again this time Kane on target. Were the floodgates going to open and were the multi million pound superstars going to pile the pressure and score a few more to end the tie and make our journey to Munich just a Jolly Bhoys?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The answer was no. Celtic battled back and once again the stadium came alive on 75 minutes or there abouts when Celtic showed just how good they can be on home soil. In the end we lost the game but we travel to Germany with a punchers chance. It would be a big upset but we can dream.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It has not been a happy hunting ground for us over the years in their old stadium I watched Martin O’ Neill’s bhoys get beat while in more recent years we have come unstuck in the new stadium. But whatever the result is Celtic fans have travelled across Europe to cheer on the bhoys of this team who have done us proud so far in the Champions League.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://celticfanzine.com/product/more-than-90-minutes-issue-136-fanzine/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59621" src="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/136-cover-.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset="https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/136-cover-.jpg 1795w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/136-cover--213x300.jpg 213w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/136-cover--727x1024.jpg 727w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/136-cover--768x1082.jpg 768w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/136-cover--1091x1536.jpg 1091w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/136-cover--1454x2048.jpg 1454w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/136-cover--624x879.jpg 624w, https://celticfanzine.com/wp-content/uploads/136-cover--600x845.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1795px) 100vw, 1795px" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Saturdays performance proved just how far away we are from the chasing pack in Scotland. There was to be no Champions League hangover as the manager made the changes to bring in fresh legs and rest some for Tuesday night.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Celtic will win the league this season but will not qualify automatically for the League stage. They are building a really good squad and now paying big money for young players and signing them on long contracts. With the millions banked from this years campaign and the experience the players have gained. Celtic will continue to invest in the squad and will be even stronger next season if we can get back into the League Stage.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The future is bright and our neighbours across the city are suffering meltdown after meltdown. Failure to beat Queens Park means that The Blue Room will remain bare and their bank account empty. While Celtic continue to build a better squad and a bigger bank balance.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Futures Bright, the futures Green and White as Celtic continue to improve.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">We also look back at the weekend win over Raith Rovers while the rangers have another meltdown at Ibrox after being knocked out of the Scottish Cup by Queens Park. Celtic will face Hibs at home in the quarter final while Aberdeen will host Queens Park.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Celtic fans Brogeal rocked the Barrowlands supporting The Mary Wallopers. Michael Pringle looks back at the gig at the famous Glasgow venue.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Scottish Cup Fifth round kick off time of 5:30pm may not have suited everyone and the 3pm kick off traditionalists would not be happy with the kick off times continually shuffled around to suit television. From a selfish point of view the kick off time suited this bhoy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It suited me because I had a late night gig Friday night and the later kick off gave me a chance to get a proper sleep before making the journey to Paradise. The later kick off gave me the luxury of a 2:45pm flight out of Dublin. Most travelling Celtic fans had opted for the earlier flights out to enjoy the match day build up. Games like this are a great day to bring younger fans over to enjoy the Celtic experience.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My flight was over booked by 8 and when I checked in I had no seat allocated but thankfully everyone got on with some no shows on the day. The flight was full of Rugby fans heading over for today’s six nations international between Scotland and Ireland in Edinburgh.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The journey was very worthwhile for Celtic fans with the Hoops beating Raith Rovers 5-0. Man of the moment Daizen Maeda turned in another Man of the Match performance and scored a Hatrick which brought his goal tally to 50 since he arrived in Glasgow from Japan and 21 this season. He also had a goal chalked off for offside. He really is in fine form.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Maeda started up front before switching to the wing later in the second half when Johnny Kenny came off the bench. Brendan Rodgers rang in the changes (9 in total) and some Celtic fans questioned why he had made so many changes on our quest to get a day out in Hampden in May.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There was no need for panic and McCowan and Yang both got on the score sheet after being given the nod to start and Callum McGregor rattled one off the bar. Viljami Sinisalo made his competitive goalkeeping debut and was only called in action twice in the first half and was almost a spectator in the second. While on spectators fair play to the Raith Rovers fans who travelled to Celtic Park in big numbers to back their team and put some SPFL teams fans to shame.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Paulo Bernardo was replaced in the first half by Hatate after picking up a foot injury but thankfully Brendan Rodgers spoke after the game and said they took him off more as a precaution and will now plan for the visit of Bayern Munich with Maeda now available for the game after his red card ban was reduced to one game.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is always nice to catch up with fellow St. Margarets CSC members on match day. Shout out to Billy, Colm, Jamie, Vincent and Zac. Big shout to Jeff for the lift home. I was tucked up in bed for midnight with the match day program for company.</p>
