<p>After January and summer transfer windows full of rumours surrounding Celtic’s player of the season, his time at Celtic Park may be coming to an end. Atletico Madrid, Brighton, Southampton, Chelsea and Juventus have all kept tabs on the Danish international, but it has seemed like Italian Europa League winners Atalanta are most likely to call trumps on the signature of the 23-year-old.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Atalanta’s negotiation tactics with Celtic may seem strange with “La Dea” having sent five unsuccessful bids to Celtic for the services of O’Riley. However, the negotiations between themselves and Juventus over their talisman are even stranger. Netherlands international Teun Koopmeiners has been trying to force a move away from Bergamo since March, when he announced he wanted to play his football beyond the summer elsewhere. After agreeing terms with “the Old Lady” five months ago, Juventus still haven’t met Atalanta’s €60 million price tag as their penultimate offer reached just €55 million. Juventus’ most recent offer has hit €59 million and may be enough to temp Gian Piero Gasperini and the Champions League club to bid farewell to their star man as his relationship with the fans that once loved him has become very ugly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In comparison, Celtic fans can have no complaints over the professionalism and commitment of Matt O’Riley in the second half of last season, preseason and the opening two games of this Scottish Premiership season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The completion of the sale of Koopmeiners looked likely to spark Atalanta to put the foot down, in order to strike a deal with Celtic but in a confusing 24 hours it looks like they may take their business elsewhere. On X, Fabrizio Romano said: “Atalanta met with Lazar Samardzić’s agent today, agreement close on personal terms.” Udinese midfielder, Lazar Samardzić matches a similar profile to O’Riley and offers a cheaper alternative who’s already proven in Italy’s premier division.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Atalanta have well and truly pulled out of the O’Riley deal who could be other possible suitors? Southampton were previously priced out of a move to reunite O’Riley with former manager and Scotland international, Russell Martin. Celtic’s main financial asset worked alongside Martin at MK Dons and with the Saints needing to strengthen to avoid relegation they may come sniffing around again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Atletico Madrid and Juventus have likely got what they needed from the window in that area of the pitch with the signings of Connor Gallagher from Chelsea and Teun Koopmeiners from Atalanta, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This would all point to Brighton being the most likely candidates despite already having spent an excess of €100 million this window. Billy Gilmour has all but completed a move to Napoli which may see new manager Fabian Hürzeler make a move for the Dane despite the two players filling slightly different roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By no means do Celtic need to sell Matt O’Riley this summer. There is no reason why the midfielder won’t be seen in the Hoops for another season as Celtic hold all the aces when it comes to any negotiations. O’Riley still has 3 years left on his deal at Parkhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Celtic do cash in on O’Riley, where would the club go next?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Augsburg and Belgium U21 midfielder, Arne Engels has emerged as the most likely target to fill any central midfielder vacancy. Engels has enjoyed two solid seasons in Germany’s topflight after signing from Club Brugge at 18-years-old. Engels has an impressive resume and at just 20-years-old was in contention for Belgium’s Euro 2024 squad, being part of the preliminary squad which was cut. Engels looks like a ‘8’ who is more than capable at both ends of the pitch and would be a great signing for the Scottish champions despite costing easily €10 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celtic are also monitoring Dundee captain and club player of the year, Luke McCowan. McCowan has received attention from clubs across Scotland’s topflight as Hibs have had three bids in the region of £700k rejected by “The Dark Blues”. Celtic could swoop in and pick up one of the league’s most promising players for just shy of £1 million although this doesn’t seem likely to be an O’Riley replacement. Odin Thiago Holm’s lacklustre Celtic career may see him out on loan to make way for Dundee’s penalty expert, which is a quality Celtic are desperately in need of.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third and most recent candidate linked with a move to Glasgow’s East End is Switzerland U21 international, Alvyn Sanches. The Laussane Sport midfielder’s name was flying about the rumour mill earlier in the window, but his name has resurfaced amid O’Riley’s exit rumours flaring up. Sanches scored five times in the Swiss topflight last season and plays in a slightly more advanced role to Celtic’s number 33.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celtic getting their recruitment spot on could never be more important with the financial implications of a successful Champions League campaign never greater. Celtic should demand as much money as possible for O’Riley and reinvest into a highly capable replacement who keeps the Celts’ quality midfield trio intact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Celtic’s flag day thrashing of Kilmarnock extends their scoring spree of scoring four or more goals in a game, to five. After the Hoops started their preseason with a 1-1 draw with Ayr United they’ve recorded wins against Queen’s Park, D.C United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Kilmarnock scoring 22 goals in the process.</p>



<p>Preseason, the opening day results and what’s going on across the city would makes Celtic the early favourites in this season’s championship race but if the squad isn’t further strengthened yet another European disappointment is likely on the horizon as well as a later season collapse. In a few positions Celtic are just an injury or suspension away from being without a player natural to the role.</p>



<p>Almost eight weeks into the transfer window, Kyogo is now the only recognised striker at Parkhead. Celtic made their money back on South Korean striker Hyun-Gyu Oh after one and a half unfulfilled seasons in the Hoops. Adam Idah’s six-month loan contract expired meaning he returned to Norwich City after a pleasantly surprising period for fans who have made their love for the player shown, which has been mirrored by the Irishman. Despite a deal for the striker looking the best move for all parties, the Canaries and their manager Johannes Hoff Thorup are proving a difficult nut to crack valuing Idah at £7.5 million. Surely, Celtic will sign a striker before the transfer window shuts in three weeks or so but whether that will be the man so important to Celtic’s league and cup double charge is still to remain.</p>



<p>Striker isn’t the only position Celtic are short in numbers, with Greg Taylor being the club’s only first-team left-back. Taylor has improved his reputation at Celtic Park after a tough start to his Celtic career but relying on him as the only option would leave a lot of fans uneasy. After the Alexandro Bernabei experiment failed and with the Argentine out on loan it leaves Celtic with no option but to find a replacement. Wolves left-back Hugo Bueno has emerged as the club’s top target. The Spaniard started seven Premier League games for the Wanderers last season while making 22 appearances. The Midlands club have stated Bueno is ‘important to their plans’ which may see Celtic look elsewhere.</p>



<p>Celtic need to strengthen in other areas including left of central defence and with the addition of a winger. Unlike the previous areas mentioned these come more as luxuries rather than necessities but if Celtic want to compete in this season’s Champions League, these problems will need to be addressed. Celtic may also have to look for a Matt O’Riley replacement if the club cashes in for the windfall of the Danish international although selling is no where near a must.</p>

<p>On the face of it, last season was a good one for Celtic. A League and Cup double should be a reflection of a successful campaign, but it would be churlish to think that all was well. Results, in general, were good but there many performances that were unacceptable during the course of the season. Looking back, it’s noticeable how important those late, late wins were at Easter Road and Fir Park during February and March. Failure to win even one of those games could have had catastrophic consequences when the prizes were handed out in May. <br><br>Ten players were purchased by Celtic during the summer of 2023. It’s a sad indictment that not a single one of them made a significant contribution during the course of the season, not one of them was able to hold down a regular first team place. So much so that, at the season’s end, when Celtic finally hit form, Brendan Rodgers was required to utilise Ange Postecoglou’s side – minus Jota, Starfelt, Mooy, and eventually Abada – which in the end was a considerable achievement, highlighting Rodgers’ organisational and motivational skills which saw Celtic over the line. It was a case of having to go to the well for one last time with that squad of players and reinforcements are desperately needed. To coin a phrase – we got away with it.<br><br>The Celtic Board should realise that there is a sense of anticipation and expectation amongst we supporters this summer. The club literally has tens of millions sitting in the bank. We have the Champions League windfall to come. And we have the season ticket funds, from the supporters, which arrives each summer. On that subject, it was a bit bold raising the season ticket prices during a cost of living crisis, at a time when the club is so financially affluent.<br><br>Returning to last season’s campaign, there were times when the league title looked to be in the bag. The early season winning run until October and the 2-1 New Year win over Rangers at Celtic Park, twice saw Celtic with considerable leads, which they then surrendered over a period. Even when winning games, the team wasn’t playing consistently well and, in football terms, we were papering over the cracks. The overall Celtic performance last season did not match what the supporters expect.<br><br>Some may read this and see it as a sense of entitlement. However, you have to appreciate the advantage which Celtic have in terms of resources. We have by far the biggest stadium, the biggest fan base, and enjoy, at this time, an enormous financial advantage over our rivals. The resources and finances we have must be utilised to our advantage. This summer has to see quality players attracted to Celtic Park. No more projects, young guys with potential, but established, quality players who will be seen as an improvement and be able hold down a first team place and improve the team. Celtic fans pay a lot of money each summer and are entitled to enjoy a certain standard of player and the quality which they bring.<br><br>The reason for doing this is twofold. Firstly, we want to sustain our position as Scotland’s premier club. But perhaps more important, we do not want to go into the new Champions League set up and be used as cannon fodder, as has happened these last few seasons. For all his faults, you have to go back to Neil Lennon’s tenure as Celtic manager to find a time when Celtic made any impression whatsoever in European football. This is a source of great frustration and does not reflect well on Celtic’s supposed ambition as a major European football force. It’s about time the Board matched the aspirations and desires of the supporters and that MUST start this summer by recruiting a considerably better standard of player.<br><br>Last summer’s player recruitment was absolutely shambolic. Some signings were ordinary, some were mediocre, and some were downright poor. We are now saddled with a number of players who Celtic will have considerable trouble off-loading and there will be financial loss on them.<br><br>Almost every area of the team needs improvement. A new goalkeeper to replace the inspirational Joe Hart. A left sided centre back to accompany Cameron Carter-Vickers. A holding midfield player to ease the strain on Callum McGregor. A replacement for Matt O’Riley, who will surely be leaving for pastures new. And two quality wingers to augment Maeda and Forrest. The wide players are absolutely vital to Rodgers’ system. That was the one area which affected the team most last season, especially when Maeda was injured. Kyogo thrives on the service from the wings and nothing was forthcoming. The new recruits to play in those roles, Yang, Tilio, Palma and Kuhn, have been especially disappointing. It’s also hoped that deals can be agreed for Adam Idah and Paolo Bernardo, who will hopefully contribute more now that they are used to playing in Scotland for a period.<br><br>As the club basks in the success of last season, the fixtures have now been announced and fans cast an eye towards the new league campaign. No one was really expecting much to happen regarding transfers until July. With the Euros in full swing and the transfer window not opening until I July, the months of July and August will be absolutely vital for the Celtic Board to bring sufficiently higher quality players to the club and give Brendan Rodgers the backing which he deserves as Celtic manager.<br><br>Failure to do so, and another mediocre season endured, will not be easy for Celtic fans to tolerate. The patience of the supporters has been sorely tested. It’s all very well to be financially solvent, but sitting on that money and not putting it to good use is actually a considerable form of negligence in itself. The Celtic Board will do well to remember this. Fail to act appropriately this summer and the consequences will be massive for everyone concerned.<br></p>

<p>(In other words &#8211; is it worth your while subscribing?)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is this a new beginning?</h2>



<p>Celticunderground.net and the free to air podcast are not going away, we just want to do something a little different and different costs and so we need a subscription for that but the general larking around on the pod and Saint Anthony pics and our social media presence will continue, unabashed. But things change &#8211; we launched the site in 2006 and followed shortly with the podcast but that was 18 years ago and so whilst we’re not walking away from the free website and podcast (we don’t do walking away!) there’s loads of fan media sites and pods now out there covering Celtic. As the world’s original fan football podcast, we wanted to do something different.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Why this, why now</h3>



<p>You might have noticed that the volume of podcasts and articles on the site have been slowly dwindling &#8211; sometimes life can get in the way. Also, sometimes doing the same thing for 18 years can start to diminish the enthusiasm and so we needed a spark and that spark has come from the arrival of Andrew H Smith.</p>



<p>A journalist of excellent repute, Andrew has spent over 30 years at the peak of the industry in Scotland and when the opportunity arose to work with him we wanted to use his skills and experience to deliver something different for the listeners and readers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Substack &#8211; more than a blog or podcast or twitter</h3>



<p>Older readers may recall the early internet days before podcasts, blogs and social media when the fan media interaction was more like community message boards. Substack sells itself as an online platform that allows journalists, writers, and other content creators to publish newsletters, videos and podcasts and circulate to their readers and listeners in a more interactive way. Substack’s main function is connecting the creator and their audience combining the features of a blog and email newsletter. Authors can use the platform for personal writing or news, and send digital newsletters directly to a reader’s inbox. There are also tools for podcasts and group chat broadcasts. It sounded right up our street!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. So who is going to be on this Substack thingy?</h3>



<p><strong>Andrew H Smith – Chief Writer and podcaster @Andrewsmit75299</strong></p>



<p>Andrew started his journalistic career at The Celtic View over 30 years ago, shortly before the Fergus McCann revolution – something he discusses at length in two of our forthcoming podcasts. After leaving The View he progressed on a 30-year career in the written press with the Scotland on Sunday and then the Scotsman, focussing on the football of our dear green city and specifically Celtic and the Rangers.</p>



<p>With more than 30 years experience in Scottish sports journalism, Andrew has covered everything from domestic football to international events and European cup finals. He has been shortlisted for UK awards&nbsp;and has been a vociferous campaigner against racism and sectarianism in Scottish football.</p>



<p><strong>Eddie Pearson – Rumour Mill and podcaster (@celticrumours)</strong></p>



<p>Eddie Pearson featured in the first ever eleven for Celtic, but little is fully known about this player.&nbsp; Born on 16th March 1863 in Holytown (Lanarkshire), he was to become a right-back for Carfin Shamrock.&nbsp; Eddie Pearson had the honour to play for Celtic in the club’s inaugural match, a 5-2 friendly win over Rangers, a major note in retrospect. However, he never played for Celtic in another match, so he never played in any competition matches with Celtic….but this isn’t our Eddie!</p>



<p>Our Eddie Pearson was the founding father of The Celtic Underground.&nbsp; In a previous guise who could be found waxing lyrically about made up transfer gossip on the Etims Rumour Mill before setting up The Celtic Underground.&nbsp; The original host of the podcast, life got a got in the way and he handed the baton over to Harry Brady.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Harry Brady – General ramblings and podcaster (@HarrybradyCU)</strong></p>



<p>Harry Brady had a season book in the main stand at decades.&nbsp; A bit like Breakfast at Bernies, Harry was long gone but in the days of season books in the main stand only, his ticket was passed from pillar to post as and new Harry’s popped up as regularly as new James Bonds.</p>



<p>Our version of Harry Brady is known to his friends as Brian Gilmour and has been on the podcast almost since the beginning and hosting it for a decade.  Occasionally Harry’s opinions may be at odds with the perceived position of the online fans, but unlike some of the Johnny-come-lately fan podcasters Harry says what he thinks – not what he thinks people want to hear.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Please subscribe.</h3>



<p>We’ve spent considerable time and effort generating the content for our substack and that takes time and money. We believe in Andrew H Smith we will be providing people with a quality and standard of writing not found anywhere else on the Celtic internet. Allied to the ramblings of a couple of Celtic Da’s we’re hoping it’s something worth spending a couple of bob on once a month.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s two types of subscription over on substack and both will get fresh new content emailed directly to their inbox or available on the Substack app &#8211; it&#8217;s just that one will be premium and paid for and one is free.  We hope that, after 18 years of free listening, you might think £3.50 a month is worth it…and even better when you consider that it’s not being back dated! (also &#8211; that’s the minimum substance subscription fee.)</p>

<p>Sometimes you need to blow your own trumpet and it is with great pride that we write today to confirm that highly respected football writer Andrew H Smith is leaving the world of broadsheet journalism and joining The Celtic Underground.</p>



<p>Andrew started his journalistic career at The Celtice View over 30 years ago, shortly before the Fergus McCann revolution &#8211; something he discusses at length in two of our forthcoming podcasts.  After leaving The View he progressed on a 30 year career in the written press with the Scotland on Sunday and then the Scotsman, focussing on the football of our dear green city and specifically Celtic and the Rangers.</p>



<p>With more than 30 years experience in Scottish sports journalism, Andrew has covered everything from domestic football to international events and European cup finals. He has been shortlised for UK awards and has been a vociferous campaigner against racism and sectarianism in Scottish football.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s going to be some changes to our website and the content we deliver with the arrival of Andrew and there&#8217;ll be more on that shortly.  </p>



<p>The media world is becoming fragmented with consumers curating their own echo chamber of views and information and it’s within this context that fan media has evolved &#8211; football fans talking to other fans about their club. At Celtic Underground we’ve been doing that on the podcast for 18 seasons.</p>



<p>One thing we’ve noticed in doing the podcast is the expectation from listeners is continual improvement in quality. Gone are the days when I can have a chat on the phone whilst walking the dog and people accept cars whizzing by as they consume their Celtic chat.  </p>



<p>We want to keep true to the foundation of CU and we will continue with the standard output from likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/Stephen4_2">@Stephen4_2</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/celticrumours">@celticrumours</a> but in this fragmented media world, people also want more.  We want to keep true to the foundation of CU and we will continue with the standard output from likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/Stephen4_2">@Stephen4_2</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/celticrumours">@celticrumours</a> but in this fragmented media world, people also want more.</p>



<p>And so, in addition to the usual rubbish, we’re sprinkling a little bit of quality. Andrew Smith is leaving the broadsheet newspaper world and joining Celtic Underground. He’ll be using his extensive contact list to bring listeners a range of high quality guests.  There’ll be some changes to the site and the quality and quantity of the podcasts with more detail coming soon. We’ve got this weeks podcast reviewing Dundee &amp; previewing Hearts then 2 pods on his time working with Fergus.</p>

<p>Daniel Kelly has all but burst onto the scene for Celtic over the past few weeks. After only signing his first contract in 2022, what he has done in the last two years as a teenager must provoke excitement in all Celtic fans. After leading Celtics B team to their Glasgow cup win in the 2022/23 season and starting regularly in the lowland league and the UEFA youth league at 17 it was hard to deny his talent.</p>



<p>Brendan liked what he saw as he decided to include Kelly in his pre-season side that went to Japan and Portugal. He went on to impress further early this season scoring twice in the UEFA youth league as well as scoring in the lowland league. Although it was clear as day that Kelly was a level above the lowland league as he bossed the midfield in almost every game he played.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brendan decided he was ready for competitive first team football, selecting him on the bench for the team’s Scottish cup tie against Buckie Thistle. Kelly went on to score coming off the bench in this game, putting him in the spotlight of fans. From then on he has been a regular bench player in the first team, although one might say it is due to injury in that area, but he has been selected over Odin Holm on many occasions so he must have something really special in Brendan’s eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his league debut against Dundee, he scored too after coming on for captain Calum McGregor, which is pressure for any player let alone a young 18-year-old.</p>



<p>The question is will Brendan give Kelly the development and opportunity he deserves, as we have seen in the past young players break through the youth system then end up not getting a chance to prove themselves. Names like Karamoko Dembele and Ben Doak come to mind. But right now with injuries to Calum McGregor and Reo Hatate, Kelly has a great chance to get a good run in the team, which he has been doing. If the rumours about Matt O’Riley that circulate in the media are true there could potentially be another opening in the midfield come summer, and I think Kelly is ready to take that spot in the rotation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A young Scottish player filled with passion and fight, scoring in the cup and the league at 18, if history is anything to go off of, Celtic fans could have a very special player on their hands for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Celtic Women have injected life into this season’s title race by handing Rangers their first loss of the season. A first half double from the Ghirls’ marquee January signing Natasha Flint saw off the league leaders despite Jane Ross’ second half strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flint opened the scoring after just five minutes. Her first attempt was saved by Jenna Fife, but she capitalised on the rebound first, to finish comfortably from close range. Within five minutes of the first half ending, Flint had her second. Lucy Ashworth-Clifford&#8217;s cross caused problems for the Rangers defence and Tessel Middag’s mishit clearance fell perfectly for the Celtic striker to put the home side 2-0 up at the break. After a defensive shambles in the Celtic penalty area, Ross halved Rangers’ deficit, but Celtic held on for a monumental victory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elena Sadiku had a difficult act to follow in Fran Alonso. Alonso brought a charismatic and winning energy to Glasgow. The Spanish coach, who moved to NWSL side Houston Dynamo, was replaced by the Swedish manager at the beginning of the year. In Alonso’s three-year spell he led his teams to; two Scottish Cup triumphs and a SWPL Cup, but the Scottish Women’s Premier League always evaded the coach amid last season’s last day heartbreak. Celtic still look for their first league championship and will have the opportunity to have a noisy Celtic Park atmosphere push them towards a possibly historic season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadiku spoke to Celtic TV, after the match: “I feel very happy. I feel the happiness from the girls, I know how much they work every day.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The first half shows the potential of this team. I’ve been saying it after every game, it’s not the full potential, I still believe we have more to give.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This St Patrick’s Day showdown may be looked upon as a possible turning point in where the bragging rights may head at the end of the season. Rangers looked unbeatable, and were, for 22 league matches until Sadiku’s side thwarted Jo Potter’s team on the Swede’s third attempt facing the Gers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celtic’s win at the Excelsior Stadium moves them just a single point behind their Old Firm rivals and brings Glasgow’s big three within a point of each other. Glasgow City looked out of the title race for good earlier in the season after a terrible start, but 11 straight wins have moved them right on the shoulders of their title rivals. You would imagine the holders and record winners will have a major say as to where the silverware is heading this campaign. With nine of the 10 post-split games still to be played, there is certain to be a few more twists before we find out where the title is heading. Celtic, Rangers and Glasgow City return to league action in two weeks&#8217; time. Rangers’ SWPL cup final against Partick Thistle will be the only game to be played next weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cameron Carter-Vickers our knight in shining armour. After a not so convincing win over Livingston last week, Celtic have bounced back with a very convincing win over St Johnstone. The team looked so much more fluid going forward and the difference between having CCV and not having him is night and day, he all but controlled the back line and kept a sense of calmness at the back.</p>



<p>In the first half hour or so of the game Celtic were all over St. Johnstone but could not finish their dinner. Although in the first half alone we had 3 goals chopped off for offside, which with hindsight, were off. At the half hour mark Celtic had a chance from a corner. The ball fell to Carter-Vickers whose shot was blocked; the ball then fell perfectly to Daizen Maeda whose shot was also blocked but this time by the arm of Luke Robinson. After the VAR check that followed, no penalty was giving which was daylight robbery.</p>



<p>Man of the match Nicolas Kuhn was continuing his great form from last week and had St Johnstone’s left back Luke Robinson in his back pocket. It seemed as though we were going to go into half time goalless until Kuhn twisted and turned to beat his man before delivering a perfectly weighted ball to Kyogo Furuhashi (who else) who took flight to head it home, 1-0.</p>



<p>Celtic went into half time 1-0 up with an air of confidence about them. Following the break, during which Celtic had a heart-warming showing alongside the charity cafefootball, we came out flying. Not even a minute in Maeda found Kyogo out wide on the left who squared it to his partner in crime Kuhn, who had an easy finish, 2-0. The football we were playing after this was liquid, although we struggled to put away a lot of chances, including an unlucky strike by Kyogo that pelted the cross bar and an ambitious free kick by Matt O’Riley that was denied by the keeper.</p>



<p>Brendan then decided it was time for a change, he brought off Kuhn who was walking gingerly as he walked off and Paulo Bernardo, bringing on James Forrest and youngster Daniel Kelly. Although they say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, there’s nothing to say an old dog can’t use their old tricks as Forrest made an instant impact burying a lovely finish after O’Riley found him in barrels of space after only being on the park four minutes, 3-0.</p>



<p>Celtic continued on the front foot for the next ten minutes until Brendan decided to bring off Kyogo and CCV, bringing on Odin Holm and Adam Idah. Now I hear you ask, Carter Vickers coming off, will that not leave us weak at the back? Yes. It did, as Conor Smith found the net five minutes later off of a rebound from a great save by Joe Hart, 3-1. Brendan responded by bringing on Lagerbielke to play centre back instead of Tomoki.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celtic could’ve easily made it four on many occasions before the final whistle but couldn’t find the net. A solid win but it does raise eyebrows about the state of the backline without Carter-Vickers, so who knows what we might do against Livingston after the break, as I can’t imagine Brendan will risk CCV getting injured.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, there was a lot of good to take away from this game, our wing play was amazing and it can only get better with the return of Palma and Yang. Our midfield does still miss Calum Mcgregor as Matt O’Riley hasn’t been at his best, although Tomoki Iwata has been quietly bossing the middle of the park. Alistair Johnston and Greg Taylor look exploitable at the back as they struggle to track back very often although the return of Carter-Vickers, Reo Hatate and hopefully Calum Mcgregor should bring considerable confidence going to Ibrox in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Celtic are through to the semi-final of the Scottish Cup, thanks to a late winner by Daizen Maeda then a very late dagger by Kyogo Furuhashi. But fans at the game and on social media were very concerned at the team’s performance and let me tell you it was rightfully so.</p>



<p>Celtic started off strong looking to go at Livingston early and had a few chances go begging, that was until Daizen Maeda made it 1-0 in the seventh minute after a brilliantly weighted ball over the top by Nicolas Kuhn had defenders sent to the shops. From there it was an easy finish for the Japanese winger. But not even five minutes later Stephen Welsh was nowhere to be seen as Livingstons left back Cristian Montano plays a long ball over the top to Daniel MacKay who found himself one on one with Joe Hart before going on to make it 1-1. Thus the first of the defensive errors begin.</p>



<p>The topic of the Celtic back line has been polarising this season with some fans holding out hope, but to those fans I’d say watch this game back. Welsh and Scales both looked nervous on the ball and very often gave it back to Hart or tried to play it forward and end up giving it away. Greg Taylor would press high up the pitch and get involved on the attack, but wouldn’t track back and would leave a big gap on the left. Alistair Johnston was the only redeeming quality as he put in a shift as usual.</p>



<p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> minute Maeda then put Celtic back in the lead with a rebound header off of a deflected Matt O’Riley shot much to the delight of the fans. From then unitl half time, Celtic were all over Livingston but were missing a lot of chances as Maeda looked to seal his hattrick but no luck.</p>



<p>From the start of first half Celtic were making chances and not taking them, I thought to myself, I hope we don’t regret not taking one of these chances. My fears were proven right when Livingston made it 2-2 as Iwata gave the ball away at the halfway line to Jamie Brandon who then gave it to Tete Yengi, who found himself getting the better of Matt O’Riley in the box before firing it into the top corner. Another occasion where Stephen Welsh was nowhere to be seen.</p>



<p>From then onward Celtic looked terrible while Livingston sat back. Kyogo and Daniel Kelly came on for Adam Idah and Paulo Bernardo who both didn’t impress me much. This spell of football was bordering on unwatchable, while we struggled to make chances in Livingstons half, Scales and Welsh struggled to get the ball out of our half. I thought to myself, we aren’t going to score here this is a disaster. Until the hero of the day Daizen Maeda decided he’d take matters into his own hands. If you count scoring a third tap in as taking matters into his own hands. As Alistair Johnston found Tomoki Iwata in the box who squared it to Maeda who didn’t have to do much to put Celtic ahead in the 85<sup>th</sup>, absolute scenes.</p>



<p>Kyogo then sealed the deal in the 95<sup>th</sup> minute as substitute James Forrest sent him in behind with barrels of space one on one with the keeper, and we know he isn’t going to miss.</p>



<p>Overall we’re through to the next round and that’s all that counts, but letting Livingston put two past us is a big worry. We need Calum McGregor back desperately as the midfield is a shell of its former self without him. With that I personally think we need to sign a new centre back and definitely a winger, but we’ve known about these problems for months now.</p>



<p>Overall, good win, bad performance this game highlighted everything wrong with the club right now.</p>

<p>Firstly I want to apologise for the pessimism of this article.&nbsp; I hope my feelings as to where the season is heading are wrong and trust me, I will be first on here to say “my bad” if we manage to turn the campaign around. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But right now Celtic 2023/24 looks like one slow-motion car crash.&nbsp; The mood surrounding the club feels like Dresden after the bombing.&nbsp; An air of despondency started the week before the final league game of last season when we realised Ange was away.&nbsp; And it has got progressively worse since.&nbsp; And it’s concerning the manager’s position that we must begin.&nbsp; We hired a replacement that divided the support.&nbsp; Now I was relaxed about it as I stupidly assumed that having brought him back, lessons would be learned from his previous stay.&nbsp; Everyone would be on the same page &#8211; recruitment-wise &#8211; and Rodgers had a point to prove with us in Europe. &nbsp;</p>



<p>God, was I gullible.&nbsp; Rodgers was only ever going to work if he was backed.&nbsp; Failure to do so would result in two things.&nbsp; His demeanour would be lower than Rishi Sunak’s approval ratings and the support wouldn’t have patience with him as a result of how he left in 2019. &nbsp; And that’s how it’s transpiring.&nbsp; However, as somebody who was happy enough for him to come back, I mustn’t kid myself on and pretend that Brendan is blameless in this looming catastrophe.&nbsp; Dropping 5 points to Kilmarnock from winning positions is on the man in the dugout.&nbsp; Yes, he’s had injuries to key players to contend with and probably the worst two transfer windows that we have ever put together. But currently, we struggle against ANY team that organises itself in a basic manner.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Against Ross County and a team whose manager had lost the plot with his side, we nearly threw away a lead as their players cut through our defence twice like a knife through butter in the closing minutes.&nbsp; (Derek Adams would be away a fortnight later) Unfortunately for us, Miovski and Watson from Aberdeen and Kilmarnock respectively, wouldn’t be as charitable as the men from Dingwall, as moves that begin in the opposition half, would see them at our penalty area within a few passes and they then bury it in the back of the net unchallenged. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is all on Rodgers.&nbsp; He has to organise the team better and make the appropriate changes.&nbsp; Just now he is looking hapless.&nbsp; I’m struggling to make a case for him and frankly unless he seriously ups his game and makes a turnaround akin to Tommy Coyne in 1990/91, then I see it only finishing one way and he will join Billy McNeill and Neil Lennon as managers who by and large failed 2nd time around.&nbsp; In his first spell he seemed to have a Midas touch in transforming players such as Stuart Armstrong, Boyata, Simunovic and Christie.&nbsp; Now it is the gaze of Medusa as Kyogo, Alisdair Johnston, Forrest and Hatate all regress.&nbsp; Only Matt O’Reilly &#8211; prior to Atletico Madrid making their public bid &#8211; has shown any sign of improvement.&nbsp; Scales has done better than I anticipated but his limitations are pretty obvious. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In my previous article, I wrote in depth about our signing policy this season, which has made a significant contribution to the gloom. Excellent players such as Jota left and players arriving &#8211; such as Kühn &#8211; are regarded with suspicion instead of any anticipation.&nbsp; The feeling in the stands (and I’m not blaming the support) is not helping with what’s happening on the pitch.&nbsp; Losing fans’ favourites and replacing them with projects who are not ready to be first choice was never going to end well and so it’s proving.</p>



<p>But one of the most damning reasons for the atmosphere surrounding Celtic is the belief that nobody in the recruitment side of the club or the board will be held accountable for the malaise. &nbsp; Mark Lawwell &amp; Craig Strachan’s jackets should surely be on a shoofly peg for last summer and this January.&nbsp; But who really believes that they are ?&nbsp; Peter Lawwell left after failing to secure “the 10” but he’s back in a move that was close to being “Bernard Higginsesque” in that it was a complete failure to understand the strength of feeling of the support against him.</p>



<p>A boost in fan morale could be made by swinging the axe on folk who have clearly failed the club.&nbsp; But nobody I know believes that will happen as getting in with the bricks at Celtic Park breeds a sense of entitlement that is off the scale.&nbsp; Make no mistake, dynasties are back.&nbsp; Professionally run organisations don’t let a former CEO return as Chairman.&nbsp; Competent companies don’t hand important jobs to offspring whose CV’s suggest an accident of birth was the significant factor as to how they ended up in position. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Should the worst come to the worst &#8211; and I fear it will &#8211; then that would be two out of the last four titles thrown away.&nbsp; If it comes to pass, then in both losing seasons, the board failed to do the bleedin’ obvious in the autumn of each year.&nbsp; In 2020/21, you didn’t have to have a degree in football management to see that Neil Lennon was drowning early on in the season.&nbsp; Getting the ball in the opposition box all of 5 times during a home defeat to Rangers, was proof that change was needed.&nbsp; A change should have been made long before we succumbed 8-2 on aggregate to a Covid-ridden Sparta Prague side.&nbsp; The fact that even after that debacle, the board sat on its hands should have led to serious director upheaval.&nbsp; As it stands only Ian Bankier has gone from that board and that was down to his choice &#8211; he wasn’t forced out.</p>



<p>This season it has been crystal clear that we needed to invest in the side after the disaster of the summer transfer window.&nbsp; Once more the board seemed happier to count the cash that is piling up in the bank as opposed to using it to address the deficiencies of the team.&nbsp; And &#8211; much as I hope that I’m wrong &#8211; the result looks likely to be the same as three years previously.&nbsp; Yet I would put money on nobody running Celtic taking any responsibility. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if Rodgers somehow confounds my expectations, this season merely reinforces my belief that the club requires a complete overhaul &#8211; from boardroom to administration, to first team and to youth level. Instead a culture of complacency &#8211; not seen for 40 years &#8211; seems to have infested the club.&nbsp; It will lead to a poisonous stand-off as the fans are not stupid. &nbsp; And failure that will likely see only the manager pay for it with his job, is not going to be enough to get the fans onside. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These are seriously worrying times for Celtic.&nbsp; A massive pot of money due to Champions League entry looks like being gifted to Rangers and we know &#8211; if nothing else &#8211; they won’t hold back in spending it.&nbsp; In the summer of 2021 a “Hail Mary” pass got us lucky with Ange.&nbsp; It is asking helluva lot for such fortune to repeat itself.&nbsp; I&nbsp; have zero faith in the board being able to go out and recruit an appropriate manager and to clear out the recruitment/scouting/youth setups that simply aren’t working. &nbsp; My suspicion is that for some time we will have a support at complete odds with the board.&nbsp; And that is a never a good place for any side to be in. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>The long term issues are for another article.&nbsp; Short term, the manger’s position must be looked at urgently. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This year is looking like a mirror image of Rodger’s last season at Leicester.&nbsp; Poor start, followed by better form.&nbsp; Break for the World Cup and it all falls apart.&nbsp; Other than at Ibrox and Tynecastle the team really has never got out of 2nd gear.&nbsp; However, an improvement in results prior to the winter break saw everyone feel better.&nbsp; But post-winter break, the performance levels are as poor as the team played in the Covid season.&nbsp; The first XI is currently way less than the sum of its parts.&nbsp; The board should be looking for somebody with a non-Celtic background to come in and attempt to win the title.&nbsp; That is a big call but properly run teams know when the game is up with a manager and to take the necessary action.&nbsp; Yes, it would cost us financially in paying Rodgers off but in all likelihood its either now or in the summer.&nbsp; Doing it now and getting somebody else in gives us a slight chance of retaining the SPFL title. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The signing of players in the summer already deemed surplus to requirements should result in Mark Lawwell being sacked immediately.&nbsp; The quality of some players being recommended in the European market should also see Craig Strachan following him out the door.&nbsp; Such action &#8211; whilst in no way a game changer when it comes to the title &#8211; would give some indication to the fans that the extent of issues within the club are being recognised.&nbsp; It would also help raise spirits within the stadium &#8211; à la the removal of Jock Brown.&nbsp; If it’s not already known in the football world, it soon will be that Celtic’s recruitment team are clearly not up to the task.&nbsp; As a result, any decent manager we approach will be aware of that and won’t touch the Celtic job with a barge-pole.</p>



<p>But realistically, is any of the above likely to occur ?&nbsp; I very much doubt it. Those running the club seem oblivious to the iceberg that we’re floating towards.&nbsp; When faced with calls to do something they come across as Amity town council when responding to Sheriff Brody.&nbsp; Michael Nicholson &#8211; by all accounts &#8211; doesn’t like the glare of publicity.&nbsp; Well, failure this season will put him right in the firing line.&nbsp; Journalists who are not anti-Celtic are already questioning his role.&nbsp; If he wants to remain a largely background figure then he has to get his finger out now.&nbsp; We pay him £750K a year &#8211; a very very handsome salary for somebody running an SPFL club.&nbsp; Its situations like the current one where has to earn it.</p>



<p>However, the very fact that nobody is holding their breath and waiting on the board to act says so much about the lack of belief in the current set-up.&nbsp; Many seem resigned to the fact that this season is a shambles and will finish with us winning nothing.&nbsp; In that event, this season &#8211; like 2020/21 &#8211; is very much on the directors.&nbsp; The difference being that I cannot see them being able to regain the supporters’ trust after a 2nd calamity in 4 years when they failed to react to unfolding events. &nbsp;</p>
